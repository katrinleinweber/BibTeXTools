In the particular time and space environmental conditions, the water system occurred in the case of non-expectation and the probability of occurrence and the resulting economic and non-economic loss is water system risk. An assessment method for water shortage risk based on variable fuzzy sets is presented in paper. Risk rate, weakness, possibility of recovery, period for reoccurrence and risk level are defined as the indexes for regional water shortage risk assessment. The suggested model is used to evaluate water shortage risk of Zhanghe irrigation region in Hubei Province in 2010 and 2020. The assessment results are in line with the situation about the level of water exploitation and utilization. The model expresses people's knowledge and experience with fuzzy concepts and it is more operative to evaluate water shortage risk.},

  Abstract     = {Transformer is the key equipment of transforming voltage and exchanging power in the power system. It's safe and reliable operation directly influences the safe level of the power system. The risk assessment of transformer is very significant to improve the reliability of the power system. A fuzzy comprehensive risk assessment model of transformer based on Borda number theory is proposed in this paper. At first, the fault types and risk factors of the transformer are analyzed. Secondly fuzzy theory is applied to quantify the risk factors. And then Borda number theory is employed to analyze influence degree and occurrence probability of transformer. At last, the assessment examples of transformer show the good reliability of this method.},

  Abstract     = {This study deals with the condition monitoring of high voltage equipment (HVE) and risk assessment in transmission power systems. Artificial intelligence is applied to use the currently available information to calculate operational risk, and take appropriate operational measures to deal with the upcoming system states. The study presents a method based on the thermographic approach for determining urgency of intervention of HVE. Age of the HVE, voltage level, overheating temperature of the hot spot, temperature of the previous overheating, dissolved gas analysis, frequency response analysis, temperature of oil insulation, the number and time of operations and gas leaking have been used as the reference inputs for the designed fuzzy controller. The results of such methods have been combined with economic factors and applied in risk maps. The method of minimal paths and method of minimal cross-section are modified to use fuzzy numbers. These methods are used to analyse the performance of high voltage substations. System performance index is calculated to make a proper decision about reconfiguration and maintenance planning. The results might serve as a good orientation in the HVE condition monitoring and they are implemented in the asset management of transmission power systems using risk map.},

  Abstract     = {Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) form an important class of models for describing and simulating the behavior of dynamic systems through causal reasoning. Owing to their abilities to make the symbolic knowledge processing simple and transparent, FCMs have been successfully used to model the behavior of complex systems originating from numerous application areas, such as economy, politics, medicine, and engineering. However, the design of FCMs necessarily involves domain experts to develop a graph-based model composed of a collection of system's concepts and causal relationships among them. Consequently, since humans exhibit an intrinsic factor of subjectivity and are only able to efficiently develop small-size graph-based models, there is a legitimate need to devise methods capable of automatically learning FCM models from data. This research addresses this need by introducing a competent memetic algorithm to generate FCM models from available historical data, with no human intervention. Extensive benchmarking tests performed on both synthetic and real-world data quantify the performance of the competent memetic method and emphasize its suitability over the models obtained by conventional and noncompetent hybrid evolutionary approaches in terms of accuracy, approximation ability, and convergence speed. Moreover, the proposed approach is shown to be scalable due to its capability to efficiently learn high-dimensional FCM models.},

The proposed modeling framework consists of a fuzzy relational hybrid model (FRHM) structure and an online identification algorithm. The FRHM structure has some useful properties, e.g., the ability of modeling both hard and soft switchings (even simultaneously), model transparency (in view of knowledge extraction and knowledge embedment), and possibility of connecting disjoint models through mathematical operations (to construct larger model structures). In addition, the proposed FRHM structure can be used to model a wide variety of hybrid dynamical systems, including nonlinear dynamical systems, dynamical systems with switchings or logical functions, dynamical systems with discrete-valued or qualitative inputs and/or outputs, etc. The fuzzy relational hybrid dynamical system is an important product of the proposed modeling structure, which, in this paper, has applied to modeling an asynchronous dc-dc buck converter as the case study.},

The system gathers and combines geographical, ecological, and physicochemical data of lichen responses to pollution within a computer program that (1) recognizes groups of indigenous species suitable for long-term pollution monitoring and (2) estimates pollution levels from species distribution data. Thereby, the proposed scheme provides a means to convert species field data to measurements under conditions of uncertainty. The proposed biosurveillance program has been successfully tested at a small scale, proving its functionality even under conditions of increased uncertainty. Within a suitable management framework, it could further be utilized in environmental impact studies and risk assessment (positive or analytic approach), short-term decision making (normative or tactical approach), and long-term policy making (normative or strategic approach).},

1. four important issues in risk assessment},
  Abstract     = {Random variability and imprecision are two distinct facets of the uncertainty affecting parameters that influence the assessment of risk. While random variability can be represented by probability distribution functions, imprecision (or partial ignorance) is better accounted for by possibility distributions (or families of probability distributions). Because practical situations of risk computation often involve both types of uncertainty, methods are needed to combine these two modes of uncertainty representation in the propagation step. A hybrid method is presented here, which jointly propagates probabilistic and possibilistic uncertainty. It produces results in the form of a random fuzzy interval. This paper focuses on how to properly summarize this kind of information; and how to address questions pertaining to the potential violation of some tolerance threshold. While exploitation procedures proposed previously entertain a confusion between variability and imprecision, thus yielding overly conservative results, a new approach is proposed, based on the theory of evidence, and is illustrated using synthetic examples},

The physics of failure accounts for the failure mechanisms involved (a lognormal distribution was presumed); the interactions (synergies) between the technology factors depending on the manufacturing techniques are considered. The basis of this methodology (called SYRP=synergetic reliability prediction) is the assessment of failure-risk coefficients (FRC), based on fuzzy logic, for the potential failure mechanisms induced at each manufacturing step. These FRC are corrected at the subsequent steps by considering the synergy of the manufacturing factors, At the end of the manufacturing process, final FRC are obtained for each potential failure mechanism; the parameters of the lognormal distribution are calculated with a simple algorithm. Experimental results for four lots of the same type of semiconductor devices, each lot being manufactured with a slightly different technology, were obtained. SYRP forecasts for these four lots agree well with accelerated life test results. This is a fairly good result, because SYRP was used early, at the design phase},

  Abstract     = {Fuzzy probability theory is an extension of probability theory to dealing with mixed probabilistic/non-probabilistic uncertainty. It provides a theoretical basis to model uncertainty which is only partly characterized by randomness and defies a pure probabilistic modeling with certainty due to a lack of trustworthiness or precision of the data or a lack of pertinent information. The fuzzy probabilistic model is settled between the probabilistic model and non-probabilistic uncertainty models. The significance of fuzzy probability theory lies in the treatment of the elements of a population not as crisp quantities but as set-valued quantities or granules in an imprecise manner, which largely complies with reality in most everyday situations. Probabilistic and non-probabilistic uncertainty and imprecision can so be transferred adequately and separately to the results of a subsequent analysis. This enables best case and worst case estimates in terms of probability taking account of variations within the inherent non-probabilistic uncertainty. The development of fuzzy probability theory was initiated by H. Kwakernaak with the introduction of fuzzy random variables in 1978. The usefulness of the theory has been underlined with various applications beyond mathematics and computer science. An increasing interest in fuzzy probabilities and related concepts has been developed, in particular, in engineering. In this summary, a general introduction to fuzzy probability theory is given. Detailed mathematical descriptions and discussions in an engineering context are provided in.},

  Abstract     = {Machine learning plays an important role in data classification and data-based prediction. In some real-world applications, however, the training data (coming from the source domain) and test data (from the target domain) come from different domains or time periods, and this may result in the different distributions of some features. Moreover, the values of the features and/or labels of the datasets might be nonnumeric and involve vague values. Traditional learning-based prediction and classification methods cannot handle these two issues. In this study, we propose a multistep fuzzy bridged refinement domain adaptation algorithm, which offers an effective way to deal with both issues. It utilizes a concept of similarity to modify the labels of the target instances that were initially predicted by a shift-unaware model. It then refines the labels using instances that are most similar to a given target instance. These instances are extracted from mixture domains composed of source and target domains. The proposed algorithm is built on a basis of some data and refines the labels, thus performing completely independently of the shift-unaware prediction model. The algorithm uses a fuzzy set-based approach to deal with the vague values of the features and labels. Four different datasets are used in the experiments to validate the proposed algorithm. The results, which are compared with those generated by the existing domain adaptation methods, demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy in both the above-mentioned datasets.},

  Abstract     = {Medium-voltage network operators in today's liberalized electricity market are forced to rethink their current maintenance strategies in order to improve their companies' efficiency. Consequently, preventive strategies such as reliability-centered or risk-based maintenance are increasingly gaining in importance, besides the traditionally implemented time-based maintenance. One principal characteristic of preventive maintenance strategies is that the condition of the network components is inspected on a regular basis. The presented methodology shows how MV/LV substation maintenance and renewal can be optimized on the basis of inspections. A fuzzy logic model processes the information gained during inspection and determines a risk index for any substation, as well as for all basic assets within the station. The model, therefore, makes the risks presented by different substations comparable. It also provides information on weak points within the substation. Thus, the model not only facilitates but also helps to objectify the decision-making for upcoming investments.},

In order to consider the importance degrees of stakeholders and planning criteria in network planning, first importance degrees of stakeholders and planning criteria are determined by a presented new method.

  Abstract     = {Change-point (CP) regression models have been widely applied in various fields, where detecting CPs is an important problem. Detecting the location of CPs in regression models could be equivalent to partitioning data points into clusters of similar individuals. In the literature, fuzzy clustering has been widely applied in various fields, but it is less used in locating CPs in CP regression models. In this paper, a new method, called fuzzy CP (FCP) algorithm, is proposed to detect the CPs and simultaneously estimate the parameters of regression models. The fuzzy c -partitions concept is first embedded into the CP regression models. Any possible collection of all CPs is considered as a partitioning of data with a fuzzy membership. We then transfer these memberships into the pseudomemberships of data points belonging to each individual cluster, and therefore, we can obtain the estimates for model parameters by the fuzzy c-regressions method. Subsequently, we use the fuzzy c -means clustering to obtain the new iterates of the CP collection memberships by minimizing an objective function concerning the deviations between the predicted response values and data values. We illustrate the new approach with several numerical examples and real datasets. Experimental results actually show that the proposed FCP is an effective and useful CP detection algorithm for CP regression models and can be applied to various fields, such as econometrics, medicine, quality control, and signal processing.},

  Abstract     = {In fuzzy clustering, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) is the most known algorithm. Several extensions and variations of FCM had been proposed in the literature. The first important extension to FCM was proposed by Gustafson and Kessel (GK). In the GK fuzzy clustering, they considered the effect of different cluster shapes except for spherical shapes by replacing the Euclidean distance of the FCM objective function with the Mahalanobis distance. The GK algorithm has become one of the most frequently used clustering algorithms. Just like FCM, the fuzziness index m is a parameter in which the value will greatly influence the performance of the GK algorithm. However, there is no theoretical work on the parameter selection for the fuzziness index m of GK. In this paper, we reveal the relation between the stable fixed points of the GK algorithm and the datasets using Jacobian matrix analysis, and then provide a theoretical base for selecting the fuzziness index m in the GK algorithm. Some experimental results verify the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

  Abstract     = {In recent years, deep learning caves out a research wave in machine learning. With outstanding performance, more and more applications of deep learning in pattern recognition, image recognition, speech recognition, and video processing have been developed. Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) plays an important role in current deep learning techniques, as most of existing deep networks are based on or related to it. For regular RBM, the relationships between visible units and hidden units are restricted to be constants. This restriction will certainly downgrade the representation capability of the RBM. To avoid this flaw and enhance deep learning capability, the fuzzy restricted Boltzmann machine (FRBM) and its learning algorithm are proposed in this paper, in which the parameters governing the model are replaced by fuzzy numbers. This way, the original RBM becomes a special case in the FRBM, when there is no fuzziness in the FRBM model. In the process of learning FRBM, the fuzzy free energy function is defuzzified before the probability is defined. The experimental results based on bar-and-stripe benchmark inpainting and MNIST handwritten digits classification problems show that the representation capability of FRBM model is significantly better than the traditional RBM. Additionally, the FRBM also reveals better robustness property compared with RBM when the training data are contaminated by noises.},

  Abstract     = {Uncertainty and fuzziness generally exist in real-life data. Approximations are employed to describe the uncertain information approximately in rough set theory. Certain and uncertain rules are induced directly from different regions partitioned by approximations. Approximation can further be applied to datamining-related task, e.g., attribute reduction. Nowadays, different types of data collected from different applications evolve with time, especially new attributes may appear while new objects are added. This paper presents an approach for dynamic maintenance of approximations w.r.t. objects and attributes added simultaneously under the framework of decision-theoretic rough set (DTRS). Equivalence feature vector and matrix are defined first to update approximations of DTRS in different levels of granularity. Then, the information system is decomposed into subspaces, and the equivalence feature matrix is updated in different subspaces incrementally. Finally, the approximations of DTRS are renewed during the process of updating the equivalence feature matrix. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  Abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new multiattribute decision making method based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques, and the evidential reasoning methodology. The proposed method uses the evidential reasoning methodology to construct objective functions of the programming models and uses PSO techniques to get optimal weights of the attributes to get the aggregated interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy value of each alternative. Then, it calculates the transformed value of the obtained interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy value of each alternative. The larger the transformed value, the better the preference order of the alternative. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of the existing methods for multiattribute decision making based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. It provides us with a useful way for multiattribute decision making based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, PSO techniques, and the evidential reasoning methodology.},

The high interactions between terms in documents demonstrate vague and ambiguous meanings. Efficient and effective clustering methods to discover latent and coherent meanings in context are necessary. This paper presents a fuzzy linguistic topological space along with a fuzzy clustering algorithm to discover the contextual meaning in the web documents. The proposed algorithm extracts features from the web documents using conditional random field methods and builds a fuzzy linguistic topological space based on the associations of features. The associations of cooccurring features organize a hierarchy of connected semantic complexes called 閳ユ窅ONCEPTS,閳ワ拷 wherein a fuzzy linguistic measure is applied on each complex to evaluate 1) the relevance of a document belonging to a topic, and 2) the difference between the other topics. Web contents are able to be clustered into topics in the hierarchy depending on their fuzzy linguistic measures; web users can further explore the CONCEPTS of web contents accordingly. Besides the algorithm applicability in web text domains, it can be extended to other applications, such as data mining, bioinformatics, content-based, or collaborative information filtering, etc.},

  Abstract     = {Bayesian belief networks provide a natural, efficient method for representing probabilistic dependencies among a set of variables. For these reasons, numerous researchers are exploring the use of belief networks as a knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. Algorithms have been developed previously for efficient probabilistic inference using special classes of belief networks. More general classes of belief networks, however, have eluded efforts to develop efficient inference algorithms. We show that probabilistic inference using belief networks is NP-hard. Therefore, it seems unlikely that an exact algorithm can be developed to perform probabilistic inference efficiently over all classes of belief networks. This result suggests that research should be directed away from the search for a general, efficient probabilistic inference algorithm, and toward the design of efficient special-case, average-case, and approximation algorithms.},

  Abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an approach to design linguistic models which are accurate to a high degree and may be suitably interpreted. This approach is based on the development of a hierarchical system of linguistic rules learning methodology. This methodology has been thought as a refinement of simple linguistic models which, preserving their descriptive power, introduces small changes to increase their accuracy. To do so, we extend the structure of the knowledge base of fuzzy rule base systems in a hierarchical way, in order to make it more flexible. This flexibilization will allow us to have linguistic rules defined over linguistic partitions with different granularity levels, and thus to improve the modeling of those problem subspaces where the former models have bad performance},

  Abstract     = {Cardiotocography (CTG) is a biophysical method of fetal condition assessment based mainly on recording and automated analysis of fetal heart activity. The computerized fetal monitoring systems provide the quantitative description of the CTG signals, but the effective conclusion generation methods for decision process support are still needed. Assessment of the fetal state can be verified only after delivery using the fetal (newborn) outcome data. One of the most important features defining the abnormal fetal outcome is low birth weight. This paper describes an application of the artificial neural network based on logical interpretation of fuzzy if-then rules neurofuzzy system to evaluate the risk of low-fetal birth weight using the quantitative description of CTG signals. We applied different learning procedures integrating least squares method, deterministic annealing (DA) algorithm, and 蔚-insensitive learning, as well as various methods of input dataset modification. The performance was evaluated with the number of correctly classified cases (CC) expressed as the percentage of the testing set size, and with overall index (OI) being the function of predictive indexes. The best classification efficiency (CC = 97.5% and OI = 82.7%), was achieved for integrated DA with 蔚-insensitive learning and dataset comprising of the CTG traces recorded as earliest for a given patient. The obtained results confirm efficiency for supporting the fetal outcome prediction using the proposed methods.},

  Abstract     = {Researchers have previously looked into the problem of determining the connection between invasive events and network risk, and attack graph (AG) was proposed to seek countermeasures. However, AG has proved to have various limitations in practical applications. To overcome such defects, this study presents a risk flow attack graph (RFAG)-based risk assessment approach. In particular, this approach applies a RFAG to represent network and attack scenarios, which are then fed to a network flow model for computing risk flow. A bi-objective sorting algorithm is employed to automatically infer the priority of risk paths and assist risk assessment, and a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is performed to determine risk severity. Via the aforementioned processes, the authors simplify AG and follow the risk path of originating, transferring, redistributing and converging to assess security risk. The authors use a synthetic network scenario to illustrate this approach and evaluate its performance through a set of simulations. Experiments show that the approach is capable of effectively identifying network security situations and assessing critical risk.},

IT2FIS employs interval type-2 fuzzy sets in the antecedent part of each rule and the consequent realizes Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy inference mechanism. In order to render the inference fast and accurate, we propose a data-driven interval-reduction approach to convert interval type-1 fuzzy set in antecedent to type-1 fuzzy number in the consequent. During learning, the sequential algorithm learns a sample one-by-one and only once. The IT2FIS structure evolves automatically and adapts its network parameters using metacognitive learning mechanism concurrently. The metacognitive learning regulates the learning process by appropriate selection of learning strategies and helps the proposed IT2FIS to approximate the input-output relationship efficiently. An evolving IT2FIS employing a metacognitive learning algorithm is referred to as McTI2FIS. Performance of metacognitive interval type-2 neurofuzzy inference system (McIT2FIS) is evaluated using a set of benchmark time-series problems and is compared with existing type-2 and type-1 fuzzy inference systems. Finally, the performance of the proposed McIT2FIS has been evaluated using a practical stock price-tracking problem. The results clearly highlight that McIT2FIS performs better than other existing results in the literature.},

  Abstract     = {It is well known that type-1 fuzzy sets (T1 FSs) have limited capabilities to handle some data uncertainties directly, and type-2 fuzzy sets (T2 FSs) can cover the shortcoming of T1 FSs to a certain extent. Fuzzy discrete event systems (FDESs) were proposed based on T1 FSs theory. Hence, FDES may not be a satisfactory model to characterize some high-uncertainty systems. In this paper, we propose a new model, called as bifuzzy discrete event systems (BFDESs), by combining classical DESs theory and T2 FSs theory. Then, we consider the supervisory control problem of BFDESs. The bifuzzy controllability theorem and nonblocking bifuzzy controllability theorem are demonstrated. In addition, an algorithm for checking the bifuzzy controllability condition is presented. In addition, two controllable approximations to an uncontrollable language are investigated in detail. An illustrative example is provided to show the applicability and the advantages of the BFDES model.},

  Abstract     = {The nature of flight risk assessment has always been a problem of uncertainty. In order to quantify the risk somehow is important. Based on the previous related studies of airlines flight safety assessment a new flight risk assessment index system was built in this paper. Bayesian belief networks model with diagnostic and predictive inference was proposed to evaluate flight accident probability on the knowledge and experience of experts. Then by the use of two-grade fuzzy comprehensive evaluation with employing centralization statistical method, the accident consequence severity level could be obtained. The application through a practical example shows that the risk assessment can not only avoid the subjectivity of the experts but also deals with the uncertain information effectively. The assessment results can objectively and comprehensively exhibit the risk of flight for airlines, and the method turns out to be a feasible way to the flight risk assessment.},

  Abstract     = {This paper discusses basic notions underlying fuzzy sets, especially gradualness, uncertainty, vagueness and bipolarity, in order to clarify the significance of using fuzzy sets in practice. Starting with the idea that a fuzzy set may represent either a precise gradual composite entity or an epistemic construction refereeing to an ill-known object, it is shown that each of this view suggests a different use of fuzzy sets. Then, it is argued that the usual phrase fuzzy number is ambiguous as it induces some confusion between gradual extensions of real numbers and gradual extensions of interval calculations. The distinction between degrees of truth that are compositional and degrees of belief that cannot be so is recalled. The truth-functional calculi of various extensions of fuzzy sets, motivated by the desire to handle ill-known membership grades, are shown to be of limited significance for handling this kind of uncertainty. Finally, the idea of a separate handling of membership and non-membership grades put forward by Atanassov is cast in the setting of reasoning about bipolar information. This intuition is different from the representation of ill-known membership functions and leads to combination rules differing from the ones proposed for handling uncertainty about membership grades. },

  Abstract     = {Bisimulation is a central concept in the model theory of modal logic with extensive computational applications. It is a relation between two models in which related states have identical atomic properties and matching transition possibilities. Bisimulation captures the expressive power of propositional modal logic in the sense that bisimilar states are not distinguishable by any propositional modal formula. In recent years, fuzzy modal logic has received much attention because of the connection between uncertainty measures and fuzzy modalities. In this paper, we define the notion of fuzzy bisimulation and prove that, in a fuzzified version, it bears the same relationship to fuzzy modal logic that bisimulation bears to propositional modal logic.},

  Abstract     = {Given there is a great deal of uncertainty in the process of information systems security (ISS) risk assessment, the handling of uncertainty is of great significance for the effectiveness of risk assessment. In this paper, we propose an {ISS} risk assessment model based on the improved evidence theory. Firstly, we establish the {ISS} index system and quantify index weights, based on which the evidential diagram is constructed. To deal with the uncertain evidence found in the {ISS} risk assessment, this model provides a new way to define the basic belief assignment in fuzzy measure. Moreover, the model also provides a method of testing the evidential consistency, which can reduce the uncertainty derived from the conflicts of evidence. Finally, the model is further demonstrated and validated via a case study, in which sensitivity analysis is employed to validate the reliability of the proposed model.},

  Abstract     = {Failure probability of system components may vary with the changes of weather, environment and other operation conditions. The time-varying or condition-based failure probability can be represented using a fuzzy model. Based on credibility theory, this paper presents a novel operation risk assessment method to handle the two-fold uncertainty combining randomness and fuzziness in power system operations. In the proposed method, a random fuzzy model is developed to accommodate impacts due to various operation conditions and other factors on the failure probability of system components. The WECC nine-bus system, IEEE 14-bus system and an actual power system in Northeast China were used to demonstrate feasibility and applicability of the presented method. The operation risk assessment module using the proposed method has been embedded in the EMS system in a district control center of a power company to perform real-time operation risk assessment.},

  Abstract     = {There are two kinds of uncertainty. One kind arises as variability resulting from heterogeneity or stochasticity. The other arises as partial ignorance resulting from systematic measurement error or subjective (epistemic) uncertainty. As most researchers recognize, variability and ignorance should be treated separately in risk analyses. Although a second-order Monte Carlo simulation is commonly employed for this task, this approach often requires unjustified assumptions which may be inappropriate in some circumstances. We argue that the two kinds of uncertainty should be propagated through mathematical expressions with different calculation methods. Basically, interval analysis should be used to propagate ignorance, and probability theory should be used to propagate variability. We demonstrate how using an inappropriate method can yield erroneous results. We also show how ignorance and variability can be represented simultaneously and manipulated in a coherent analysis that does not confound the two forms of uncertainty and distinguishes what is known from what is assumed.},

  Abstract     = {Utilities need to ensure power grids that are highly reliable and cost-efficient as well. Periodic replacement assures reliability but causes high replacement costs. Thus, it is much better to keep power transformers as long as possible in a functional condition and ensure reliability by adequate service (maintenance and repair). Cost-efficient service requires a sequence of service of power transformers. The sequence can be defined according to some criteria that need to be tracked in course of time. The paper introduces service classes and the risk of an outage as criteria. Service classes and risk are defined according to the condition and function of power transformer's components. The paper focuses on the insulation system, which is one of the most important power transformer components. For the inspection of this component the paper introduces dissolved gas analysis and oil characteristics to find insulation system's defects and aging, respectively. For the interpretation of measurements two new interpretation methods are applied, one for dissolved gas analysis and one for the oil characteristics. They overcome certain limits while they map measurements to different defects and aging conditions. The interpretation methods are presented from a user's point of view. Literature is given for a more in depth presentation of the underlying concepts. The service concept will finally be applied to a group of power transformers that belong to a transmission system operator.},

  Abstract     = {Reliable segmentation of the colon is a requirement for three-dimensional visualization programs and automatic detection of polyps on computed tomography (CT) colonography. There is an evolving clinical consensus that giving patients positive oral contrast to tag out remnants of stool and residual fluids is mandatory. The presence of positive oral contrast in the colon adds an additional challenge for colonic segmentation but ultimately is beneficial to the patient because the enhanced fluid helps reveal polyps in otherwise hidden areas. Therefore, we developed a new segmentation procedure which can handle both air- and fluid-filled parts of the colon. The procedure organizes individual air- and fluid-filled regions into a graph that enables identification and removal of undesired leakage outside the colon. In addition, the procedure provides a risk assessment of possible leakage to assist the user prior to the tedious task of visual verification. The proposed hybrid algorithm uses modified region growing, fuzzy connectedness and level set segmentation. We tested our algorithm on 160 CT colonography scans containing 183 known polyps. All 183 polyps were in segmented regions. In addition, visual inspection of 24 CT colonography scans demonstrated good performance of our procedure: the reconstructed colonic wall appeared smooth even at the interface between air and fluid and there were no leaked regions.},

However, its approach to prioritize failure modes through a crisp risk priority number (RPN) has been highly controversial. This paper proposes two models for prioritizing failures modes, specifically intended to overcome such limitations of traditional FMEA. The first proposed model treats the three risk factors as fuzzy linguistic variables, and employs alpha level sets to provide a fuzzy RPN. The second model employs an approach based on the degree of match and fuzzy rule-base. This second model considers the diversity and uncertainty in the opinions of FMEA team members, and converts the assessed information into a convex normalized fuzzy number. The degree of match (DM) is used thereafter to estimate the matching between the assessed information and the fuzzy number characterizing the linguistic terms. The proposed models are suitably supplemented by illustrative examples.},

  Abstract     = {This paper discusses piecewise bilinear models and recurrent fuzzy systems as particular classes of dynamic fuzzy systems, which can be dealt with in the same framework due to their structural similarity. As universal approximators, they are capable of representing any continuous nonlinear system dynamics with arbitrary accuracy by means of a rule base. First, basic definitions of both systems are revisited here, and unifying canonical forms are given. Then, a stability criterion is derived for the system classes, which is based on approximating piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions and formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The main contribution is the demonstration of the stability analysis and estimation of region of attraction by means of these models, outperforming methods reported in the literature.},

  Abstract     = {Methods for the systematic application of Monte Carlo integration with importance sampling to Bayesian inference in econometric models are developed. Conditions under which the numerical approximation of a posterior moment converges almost surely to the true value as the number of Monte Carlo replications increases, and the numerical accuracy of this approximation may be assessed reliably, are set forth. Methods for the analytical verification of these conditions are discussed. Importance sampling densities are derived from multivariate normal of Student t approximations to local behavior of the posterior density at its mode. These densities are modified by automatic rescaling along each axis. The concept of relative numerical efficiency is introduced to evaluate the adequacy of a chosen importance sampling density. The practical procedures based on these innovations are illustrated in two different models.},

  Abstract     = {In recent years, our homes have been equipped with smarter and more energy-efficient electric appliances, such as smart fridges, washing machines, TVs, etc. However, it seems that cookers seem to have been left aside during this trend although, for example, in U.K., electric cookers consume up to 20% of the evening peak electricity consumption. In addition, over half of the accidental house fires are due to cooking and cooking appliances. One of the reasons for the lack of smart energy-efficient electric cookers is the complexity of performing energy-efficient control for the various cooking techniques. This paper presents a fuzzy logic-based system, which can be cheaply retrofitted in existing electric cookers to convert them to semiautonomous, energy efficient, and safe smart electric cookers. The proposed system can control the cooker heating plate to allow the semiautonomous safe operation of the most common cooking techniques including boiling, stir/shallow-frying, deep-frying, and warming. In addition, the developed system can identify when human intervention is necessary and when dangerous situations happen or are imminent. We will present several real-world experiments, which were performed in the University of Essex intelligent apartment (iSpace) with various users where the proposed system operated a cooker semiautonomously in various cooking modes, and it was shown that when compared with the human manual operation, the proposed system realized an average energy saving of 21.42%, 34.43%, and 20.29% for the boiling, stir/shallow-frying, and deep-frying cooking techniques, respectively. In addition, the realized smart cooker has shown unique safety features not present in the existing commercial cookers.},

The critical examination of different risk assessment methods help researchers and practitioners to evaluate the impact of various project related risks. The existing Fuzzy Ex-COM (Fuzzy Expert COCOMO) model is a combination of fuzzy technique and Expert COCOMO. It takes help of expertise and information from earlier activities carried. Moreover it has limitations that it cannot make room for support from other significant risk rules. The proposed work analyzes the impact of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique for software risk assessment process that integrates the non-linear learning features of neural networks with fuzzy logic having capability to deal with sensitive and linguistic data. It also helps to generate risk rules using ANN techniques to improve the accuracy of risk assessment process. The results shows that this technique with available project data and Neuro-Fuzzy Risk model gives improved results in comparison with existing Fuzzy Ex-com model.},

Third, by combining bipolar-valued fuzzy set with the rough set theory, the concept of the bipolar-valued rough fuzzy set is developed, which is the first attempt to consider inconsistent bipolarity into rough set theory. Particularly, by introducing two new operations to the rough set theory, the widely existing information losing problem in the computation process is solved. Furthermore, parameter-related and parameter-free rough degrees about the bipolar-valued fuzzy sets in a crisp approximation space are introduced. Finally, the bipolar-valued fuzzy decision information system is given; then, both the attribute reduction method and the knowledge discovery method based on the proposed roughness degree are presented.

  Abstract     = {A Distributed Intrusion Prediction and Prevention Systems (DIPPS) not only detects and prevents possible intrusions but also possesses the capability to predict possible intrusions in a distributed network. Based on the DIPS sensors, instead of merely preventing the attackers or blocking traffic, we propose a fuzzy logic based online risk assessment scheme. The key idea of DIPPS is to protect the network(s) linked to assets, which are considered to be very risky. To implement DIPPS we used a Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) with extended real time traffic surveillance and online risk assessment. To model and predict the next step of an attacker, we used a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that captures the interaction between the attacker and the network. The interaction between various DIDS and integration of their output are achieved through a HMM. The novelty of this paper is the detailed development of Fuzzy Logic Controllers to estimate the various risk(s) that are dependent on several other variables based on the inputs from HMM modules and the DIDS agents. To develop the fuzzy risk expert system, if-then fuzzy rules were formulated based on interviews with security experts and network administrators. Preliminary results indicate that such a system is very practical for protecting assets which are prone to attacks or misuse, i.e. highly at risk.},

  Abstract     = {This paper proposes a Distributed Intrusion Prevention System (DIPS), which consists of several IPS over a large network (s), all of which communicate with each other or with a central server, that facilitates advanced network monitoring. A Hidden Markov Model is proposed for sensing intrusions in a distributed environment and to make a one step ahead prediction against possible serious intrusions. DIPS is activated based on the predicted threat level and risk assessment of the protected assets. Intrusions attempts are blocked based on (1) a serious attack that has already occurred (2) rate of packet flow (3) prediction of possible serious intrusions and (4) online risk assessment of the assets possibly available to the intruder. The focus of this paper is on the distributed monitoring of intrusion attempts, the one step ahead prediction of such attempts and online risk assessment using fuzzy inference systems. Preliminary experiment results indicate that the proposed framework is efficient for real time distributed intrusion monitoring and prevention.},

The probable sequences (of events) leading to catastrophic failures are identified using risk indices which incorporate the severity as well as the probability of the contingencies. Probable collapse sequences are identified offline for different possible loading conditions using a modified fast decoupled load flow method which considers the voltage and frequency dependence of loads and generator regulation characteristics and stored in a knowledge base. Pattern recognition method and fuzzy estimation are used for online identification of collapse sequences for any operating condition from the stored database (knowledge base).},

  Abstract     = {Risk assessment of information security is an important assessment method in the process of detecting potential threats and vulnerabilities. Select methods of risk assessment based on the requirements and the security level of organizational or enterprise information system. The general assessment methods simply calculate the risk value, In this paper, we propose a risk assessment model based on classified security protection. We also build a model combined fuzzy theory and BP neural network, so that the learn capability and the expression capability can be improved. Firstly, we form a risk elements set according to the classified criteria for security protection. Secondly, we quantitate the risk factors with fuzzy theory. Thirdly, we take the results the output of multi-level fuzzy system as the input of BP neural network. According to experiment testing, the risk evaluation model can estimate risk level of the information security accurately and real-timely.},

  Abstract     = {Kernel methods and rough sets are two general pursuits in the domain of machine learning and intelligent systems. Kernel methods map data into a higher dimensional feature space, where the resulting structure of the classification task is linearly separable; while rough sets granulate the universe with the use of relations and employ the induced knowledge granules to approximate arbitrary concepts existing in the problem at hand. Although it seems there is no connection between these two methodologies, both kernel methods and rough sets explicitly or implicitly dwell on relation matrices to represent the structure of sample information. Based on this observation, we combine these methodologies by incorporating Gaussian kernel with fuzzy rough sets and propose a Gaussian kernel approximation based fuzzy rough set model. Fuzzy T-equivalence relations constitute the fundamentals of most fuzzy rough set models. It is proven that fuzzy relations with Gaussian kernel are reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Gaussian kernels are introduced to acquire fuzzy relations between samples described by fuzzy or numeric attributes in order to carry out fuzzy rough data analysis. Moreover, we discuss information entropy to evaluate the kernel matrix and calculate the uncertainty of the approximation. Several functions are constructed for evaluating the significance of features based on kernel approximation and fuzzy entropy. Algorithms for feature ranking and reduction based on the proposed functions are designed. Results of experimental analysis are included to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. },

  Abstract     = {Belief networks are popular tools for encoding uncertainty in expert systems. These networks rely on inference algorithms to compute beliefs in the context of observed evidence. One established method for exact inference on belief networks is the probability propagation in trees of clusters (PPTC) algorithm, as developed by Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter and refined by Jensen et al. \{PPTC\} converts the belief network into a secondary structure, then computes probabilities by manipulating the secondary structure. In this document, we provide a self-contained, procedural guide to understanding and implementing PPTC. We synthesize various optimizations to \{PPTC\} that are scattered throughout the literature. We articulate undocumented “open secrets” that are vital to producing a robust and efficient implementation of PPTC. We hope that this document makes probabilistic inference more accessible and affordable to those without extensive prior exposure. },

  Abstract     = {This paper presents a system for assessing the risk of natural disasters, particularly under highly uncertain conditions, i.e. where neither the statistical data nor the physical knowledge required for a purely probabilistic risk analysis are sufficient. The theoretical foundation of this study is based on employing fuzzy set theory to complement the probability theory with an additional dimension of uncertainty. This would allow for expressing the likelihood of natural hazards by fuzzy probability. The fuzzy probability is characterized in terms of possibility–probability distributions, for which a new approach has been developed. The new approach has been compared with an alternative approach. Moreover, uncertainties about the correlation of the parameters of hazard intensity, damage and loss, i.e. vulnerability relations, have been considered by means of fuzzy relations. The composition of fuzzy probability of hazard and fuzzy vulnerability relation yields the fuzzy probability of damage (or loss). The system has been applied for assessing the earthquake risk in Istanbul metropolitan area. },

When they are ignored, as in the standard fuzzy arithmetic, the obtained results exhibit, in general, information deficiency. It is thus important, as argued in the paper, to revise fuzzy arithmetic to take relevant requisite constraints into account.

  Abstract     = {Fuzziness is discussed in the context of multivalued logic, and a corresponding view of fuzzy sets is given. Fuzzy random variables are introduced as random variables whose values are not real but fuzzy numbers, and subsequently redefined as a particular kind of fuzzy set. Expectations of fuzzy random variables, characteristic functions of fuzzy events, probabilities connected to fuzzy random variables, and conditional expectations and probabilities relating to fuzzy random variables are defined as images of the fuzzy set representing the fuzzy random variable under appropriate mappings. Several theorems, some of which relate to independent fuzzy random variables, are proved.},

  Abstract     = {This paper presents the stability analysis of polynomial fuzzy-model-based (PFMB) control systems, in which both the polynomial fuzzy model and the polynomial fuzzy controller are allowed to have their own set of premise membership functions. In order to address the input nonlinearity, the control signal is considered to be bounded by a sector with nonlinear bounds. These nonlinear lower and upper bounds of the sector are constructed by combining local bounds using fuzzy blending such that local information of input nonlinearity can be taken into account. With the consideration of imperfectly matched membership functions and input nonlinearity, the applicability of the PFMB control scheme can be further enhanced. To facilitate the stability analysis, a general form of approximated membership functions representing the original ones is introduced. As a result, approximated membership functions can be brought into the stability analysis leading to relaxed stability conditions. The sum-of-squares approach is employed to obtain the stability conditions based on Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.},

  Abstract     = {Conformal Predictors (CPs) are machine learning algorithms that can provide predictions complemented with valid confidence measures. In medical diagnosis, such measures are highly desirable, as medical experts can gain additional information for each machine diagnosis. A risk assessment in each prediction can play an important role for medical decision making, in which the outcome can be critical for the patients. Several classical machine learning methods can be incorporated into the CP framework. In this paper, we propose a CP that makes use of evolved rule sets generated by a genetic algorithm (GA). The rule-based GA has the advantage of being human readable. We apply our method on two real-world datasets for medical diagnosis, one dataset for breast cancer diagnosis, which contains data gathered from fine needle aspirate of breast mass; and one dataset for ovarian cancer diagnosis, which contains proteomic patterns identified in serum. Our results on both datasets show that the proposed method is as accurate as the classical techniques, while it provides reliable and useful confidence measures.},

  Abstract     = {Many different real-world applications with a high-level of uncertainty proved the good performance of the type-2 fuzzy sets (T2 FSs). Balanced diet means that the intake of each necessary nutrient meets its adequate demand and actual caloric intake balances with calories burned. Additionally, making a diversity of choice from various types of food is also essential to reduce the risk of developing various chronic diseases. Different people have a different goal and it is hard to measure how healthy the eaten meal is for those who are not the domain experts on the diet. This paper presents an adaptive personalized diet linguistic recommendation mechanism based on type-2 fuzzy logic system (T2 FLS) and genetic fuzzy markup language (GFML). First, an adaptive dietary assessment and recommendation ontology is constructed by domain experts, and then a T2 FS-based GFML, describing the fuzzy knowledge base and the fuzzy rule base of the proposed mechanism, is evolved by using genetic algorithms. Next, a T2 FS-based fuzzy inference mechanism infers the result of the dietary health level based on the evolved type-2 GFML (T2GFML). In addition, the balanced computation mechanism is also proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the T2 FLS for the diet domain knowledge. Finally, the linguistic knowledge discovery mechanism presents the discovered linguistic meaning about the meal's health level to show the involved subjects how to make a personalized diet linguistic recommendation. This type of information about the eaten meal can provide the subjects with a reference to gradually improve their unhealthy eating habit and then become healthier and healthier. Experimental results show that the results of the proposed mechanism for the T2 FLS are better than those for the type-1 fuzzy logic system (T1 FLS).},

  Abstract     = {Gunshots produce bruise patterns on persons who wear soft body armor when shot even though the armor stops the bullets. An adaptive fuzzy system modeled these bruise patterns based on the depth and width of the deformed armor given a projectile's mass and momentum. The fuzzy system used rules with sinc-shaped if-part fuzzy sets and was robust against random rule pruning: Median and mean test errors remained low even after removing up to one fifth of the rules. Handguns shot different caliber bullets at armor that had a 10%-ordnance gelatin backing. The gelatin blocks were tissue simulants. The gunshot data tuned the additive fuzzy function approximator. The fuzzy system's conditional variance V[Y|X=x] described the second-order uncertainty of the function approximation. Handguns with different barrel lengths shot bullets over a fixed distance at armor-clad gelatin blocks that we made with Type 250 A Ordnance Gelatin. The bullet-armor experiments found that a bullet's weight and momentum correlated with the depth of its impact on armor-clad gelatin (R2=0.881 and p-value <0.001 for the hypothesis that the regression line had zero slope). Related experiments on plumber's putty showed that highspeed baseball impacts compared well to bullet-armor impacts for large-caliber handguns. A baseball's momentum correlated with its impact depth in putty (R2=0.93 and p-value <0.001). A bullet's momentum similarly correlated with its armor-impact in putty (R2=0.97 and p-value <0.001). A Gujarati-Chow test showed that the two putty-impact regression lines had statistically indistinguishable slopes for p-value =0.396. Baseball impact depths were comparable to bullet-armor impact depths: Getting shot with a .22 caliber bullet when wearing soft body armor resembles getting hit in the chest with a 40-mph baseball. Getting shot with a .45 caliber bullet resembles getting hit with a 90-mph baseball.},

First, the IT2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model and the controllers are constructed by considering the mismatched membership functions. Second, on the basis of Lyapunov stability theory, the IT2 fuzzy state and output feedback controllers are designed, respectively, to guarantee that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable with extended dissipativity performance. The existence conditions of the two kinds of controllers are obtained in terms of convex optimization problems, which can be solved by standard software.

  Abstract     = {Network security risk analysis is a crucial technique in network and information security. Recently, Chen (2003) applied the COG-based similarity measures of generalized fuzzy numbers to deal with fuzzy risk analysis problems. However, when two different generalized fuzzy numbers have the same center-of-gravity (COG) points, the Chen's method cannot correctly determine the fuzzy risk. To resolve the above shortcoming and enhance the applicability of risk analysis method to the network security problem, a new hierarchical fuzzy risk assessment method is proposed. In the proposed method, a fuzzy weighted average method is presented to calculate the fuzzy risk value on the basis of the hierarchical security structures, and the ROG-based similarity measure of generalized fuzzy numbers is used to create a complete linguistic approximation model for the network security risks. Finally, two examples demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method},

  Abstract     = {New product development (NPD) is both a complex process and a substantial business risk. It still requires 6.6 ideas to generate a successful product. Thus, researchers claim that inferior new products should be eliminated at the front end. Limited by both the nature and the timing of NPD, managers often perform screening in uncertain environments and based on incomplete information. Furthermore, the conventional evaluation approaches, which encapsulate or merely discard the ambiguity and multiplicity of possible concerns, make a screening economically sound but dysfunctional as well. Since most assessments are described subjectively by linguistic terms, a comprehensive method for new product screening using fuzzy logic is proposed, in which the criteria ratings and their corresponding importance are assessed in linguistic terms described by fuzzy numbers, and fuzzy weighted average is employed to aggregate these fuzzy numbers into a fuzzy-possible-success rating (FPSR) of the product. Finally, the FPSR is translated back into linguistic terms to derive at a new product screening decision. Furthermore, a case study is cited to illustrate the performance within an actual decision process. The result shows that this approach can efficiently aid managers dealing with ambiguity and complex environments in achieving relatively realistic and informative results, as well as give managers a high degree of flexibility in decision-making. In addition, the variations in linguistic values and levels of linguistic variables have an effect on the ranges of the FPSR which ultimately, affect the selection of the NPD project.},

  Abstract     = {Accidents caused by errors and failures in human performance among traffic fatalities have a high death rate and become an important issue in public security. They are mainly caused by the failures of the drivers to perceive the changes of the traffic lights or the unexpected conditions happening accidentally on the roads. In this paper, we devised a quantitative analysis for assessing driver's cognitive responses by investigating the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments in a virtual-reality (VR) dynamic driving environment. The VR technique allows subjects to interact directly with the moving virtual environment instead of monotonic auditory and visual stimuli, thereby provides interactive and realistic tasks without the risk of operating on an actual machine. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to separate and extract noise-free ERP signals from the multi-channel EEG signals. A temporal filter is used to solve the time-alignment problem of ERP features and principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce feature dimensions. The dimension-reduced features are then input to a self-constructing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) to recognize different brain potentials stimulated by red/green/yellow traffic events, the accuracy can be reached 87% in average eight subjects in this visual-stimuli ERP experiment. It demonstrates the feasibility of detecting and analyzing multiple streams of ERP signals that represent operators' cognitive states and responses to task events.},

  Abstract     = {Due to modern pervasive wireless technologies and high-performance monitoring systems, spatio-temporal information plays an important role in areas such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS), surveillance, scheduling, planning, or industrial automation. Security or criminal/terrorist threat prevention in modern ITS is one of today's most relevant concerns. This paper presents an algorithm for online spatio-temporal risk assessment in urban environments. In its first phase, the algorithm uses the online nearest neighbor clustering (NNC) algorithm to identify a set of significant places. In the second phase, a fuzzy inference engine is employed to quantify the level of risk that each significant place poses to the place of interest (e.g., vehicle, person, building, or an object of high assets). The contributions of the presented algorithm are given as follows: 1) recognition and extraction of the set of the most significant places; 2) dynamic adaptation of the solution to time-dependent traffic distributions; 3) parametric control by adjusting geographical proximity threshold, significance threshold, and discount factor; and 4) online risk assessment. The performance of the algorithm was demonstrated on a problem of traffic density estimation and risk assessment in a virtual urban environment.},

The polynomial fuzzy observer estimates the system states using estimated premise variables. The estimated states are then employed by the polynomial fuzzy controller for the feedback control of nonlinear systems represented by the polynomial fuzzy model. The system stability of the PFMB observer-control system is analyzed based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Although using estimated premise variables in polynomial fuzzy observer can handle a wider class of nonlinear systems, it leads to a significant drawback that the stability conditions obtained are nonconvex. Matrix decoupling technique is employed to achieve convex stability conditions in the form of sum of squares. We further extend the design and analysis to polynomial fuzzy observer controller using a sampled-data technique for nonlinear systems, where only sampled-output measurements are available.

  Abstract     = {The main objective of this paper is to propose a new risk priority model for prioritizing failures in failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) on the basis of fuzzy evidential reasoning (FER) and belief rule-based (BRB) methodology. The technique is particularly intended to resolve some of the shortcomings in fuzzy FMEA (i.e., fuzzy rule-based) approaches. In the proposed approach, risk factors like occurrence (O), severity (S), and detection (D), along with their relative importance weights, are described using fuzzy belief structures. The FER approach is used to capture and aggregate the diversified, uncertain assessment information given by the FMEA team members; the BRB methodology is used to model the uncertainty, and nonlinear relationships between risk factors and corresponding risk level; and the inference of the rule-based system is implemented using the weighted average-maximum composition algorithm. The Dempster rule of combination is then used to aggregate all relevant rules for assessing and prioritizing the failure modes that have been identified in FMEA. A case study concerning an ocean going fishing vessel in a marine industry is provided and conducted using the proposed model to illustrate its potential applications and benefits.},

A new approximate model is first designed to describe a special dead-zone phenomenon encountered by the output mechanism of nonlinear systems, and the proposed smooth model can be conveniently fused with available adaptive fuzzy control techniques. In addition, the coupling effect that the dead-zone output and the time-delayed states coexist in a common coupling function makes the tracking control design more complicated. To further address this difficulty, a compensation method using mean-value theorem with Lyapunov-Krasovskii function is presented in this paper. By using the proposed output dead-zone model, and based on Lyapunov synthesis, a new optimized algorithm is developed to guarantee the prescribed convergence of tracking error and the boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop systems. Simulations have been implemented to verify the performance of the proposed fuzzy adaptive controller.},

Stochastic variables with Bernoulli random binary distribution are used to represent the defective communication links with packets loss occurring intermittently between the controller and the physical plant. An interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to describe the nonlinear plant subject to parameter uncertainties, which can be captured with the lower and upper membership functions. The IT2 fuzzy model and IT2 fuzzy controller are not required to share the same lower and upper membership functions. In order to design the state-feedback fuzzy model predictive controller, an optimization problem which minimizes the upper bound of a quadratic objective function subject to input constraints and packets dropout is formulated and solved at every sampling instant in the finite time horizon. By introducing some slack matrices, less conservative conditions are developed for system stability analysis.

  Abstract     = {In this paper we present a junction tree based inference architecture exploiting the structure of the original Bayesian network and independence relations induced by evidence to improve the efficiency of inference. The efficiency improvements are obtained by maintaining a multiplicative decomposition of clique and separator potentials. Maintaining a multiplicative decomposition of clique and separator potentials offers a tradeoff between off-line constructed junction trees and on-line exploitation of barren variables and independence relations induced by evidence. We consider the impact of the proposed architecture on a number of commonly performed Bayesian network tasks. The tasks we consider include cautious propagation of evidence, determining a most probable configuration, and fast retraction of evidence a long with a number of other tasks. The general impression is that the proposed architecture increases the computational efficiency of performing these tasks. The efficiency improvement offered by the proposed architecture is emphasized through empirical evaluations involving large real-world Bayesian networks. We compare the time and space performance of the proposed architecture with non-optimized implementations of the Hugin and Shafer–Shenoy inference architectures. },

  Abstract     = {A software development project is considered to be risky due to the uncertainty of the information (customer requirements), the complexity of the process, and the intangible nature of the product. Under these conditions, risk management in software development projects is mandatory, but often it is difficult and expensive to implement. Expert COCOMO is an efficient approach to software project risk management, which leverages existing knowledge and expertise from previous effort estimation activities to assess the risks in new software projects. However, the original method has limitation because it cannot effectively deal with imprecise and uncertain inputs in the form of linguistic terms such as: Very Low (VL), Low (L), Nominal (N), High (H), Very High (VH) and Extra High (XH). This paper introduces the fuzzy-ExCOM methodology that combines the advantages of a fuzzy technique with Expert COCOMO methodology for risk assessment in software projects. The validation of this approach with industrial data shows that fuzzy-ExCOM provides better risk assessment results with a higher level of sensitivity with respect to risk identification compared to the original Expert COCOMO methodology.},

  Abstract     = {The uncertainty in forecasted precipitation remains a major source of uncertainty in real time flood forecasting. Precipitation uncertainty consists of uncertainty in (i) the magnitude, (ii) temporal distribution, and (iii) spatial distribution of the precipitation. This paper presents a methodology for propagating the precipitation uncertainty through a deterministic rainfall-runoff-routing model for flood forecasting. It uses fuzzy set theory combined with genetic algorithms. The uncertainty due to the unknown temporal distribution of the precipitation is achieved by disaggregation of the precipitation into subperiods. The methodology based on fuzzy set theory is particularly useful where a probabilistic forecast of precipitation is not available. A catchment model of the Klodzko valley (Poland) built with HEC-1 and HEC-HMS was used for the application. The results showed that the output uncertainty due to the uncertain temporal distribution of precipitation can be significantly dominant over the uncertainty due to the uncertain quantity of precipitation. },

  Abstract     = {It is standard practice within most U.S. regions and locales to mobilize publicly-funded resources to respond to and recover from the effects of potentially harmful events afflicting their citizens. This paper proposes the use of fuzzy systems to characterize the relationship between the performance of regional risk mitigation capabilities (e.g., response and recovery) and the potential for loss attributed to plausible initiating events. In particular, the 37 capabilities described in the Department of Homeland Security's Target Capabilities List v2.0 are leveraged to develop an approximate functional relationship between their individual effectiveness and their collective ability to reduce risk. The details of this model are described and demonstrated via a simple example.},

  Abstract     = {To date, because of the computational complexity of using a general type-2 fuzzy set (T2 FS) in a T2 fuzzy logic system (FLS), most people only use an interval T2 FS, the result being an interval T2 FLS (IT2 FLS). Unfortunately, there is a heavy educational burden even to using an IT2 FLS. This burden has to do with first having to learn general T2 FS mathematics, and then specializing it to an IT2 FSs. In retrospect, we believe that requiring a person to use T2 FS mathematics represents a barrier to the use of an IT2 FLS. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is unnecessary to take the route from general T2 FS to IT2 FS, and that all of the results that are needed to implement an IT2 FLS can be obtained using T1 FS mathematics. As such, this paper is a novel tutorial that makes an IT2 FLS much more accessible to all readers of this journal. We can now develop an IT2 FLS in a much more straightforward way},

Fire in road tunnels in combination with tunnel safety provisions failure may lead to catastrophic consequences, and thus, necessitates a robust and reliable approach to assess tunnel risks. This article proposes a quantitative risk assessment model for fire in road tunnel by taking into consideration two types of uncertainties. A Monte Carlo-based estimation method is developed to propagate parameter uncertainty in quantitative risk assessment model consisting of event tree analysis as well as consequence estimation models. The percentile-based individual risks and 伪-cut-based societal risks are put up and the risk indices are proven to be very useful for tunnel operators with distinct risk attitudes to assess the safety level of a road tunnel. Finally, the proposed research methodology is applied to Singapore KPE road tunnels.},

  Abstract     = {Determinization of fuzzy finite automata is understood here as a procedure of their conversion into equivalent crisp-deterministic fuzzy automata, which can be viewed as being deterministic with possible infinitely many states, but with fuzzy sets of terminal states. Particularly, significant determinization methods are those that provide a minimal crisp-deterministic fuzzy automaton equivalent to the original fuzzy finite automaton called canonization methods. One canonization method for fuzzy finite automata, the Brzozowski type determinization, has been developed recently by Jancic and Ciric in [10]. Here we provide another canonization method for a fuzzy finite automaton A = (A, 锜�, 鏈�, r) over a complete residuated lattice 閿燂拷, based on the degrees of inclusion of the right fuzzy languages associated with states of A into the left derivatives of the fuzzy language recognized by A. The proposed procedure terminates in a finite number of steps, whenever the membership values taken by 鏈�, 锜�, and r generate a finite subsemiring of the semiring reduct of 閿燂拷. This procedure is generally faster than the Brzozowski type determinization, and if the basic operations in the residuated lattice 閿燂拷 can be performed in constant time, it has the same computational time as all other determinization procedures provided in [8], [11], and [12].},

  Abstract     = {With increment in the penetration of wind energy in power systems, the necessity of considering its impacts on transmission expansion planning (TEP) studies, especially for large scale wind farms, is inevitable. A new multi-objective (MO) optimization transmission expansion planning algorithm considering wind farm generation is presented in this two-paper set. Part I is mainly devoted to derivation of the theory and algorithm. The objective functions used in the TEP studies take into account investment cost, risk cost and congestion cost. The combination of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and Point Estimation Method (PEM) is implemented to investigate the effects of network uncertainties. Due to its comparative assessment potential and good handling of the non-convex problems and non-commensurable objective functions, the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) is widely used for evaluating the MO optimization problem. Eventually, for selecting the final optimal solution, a Fuzzy decision making approach is applied based on decision maker preferences.},

  Abstract     = {In this study, we introduce a concept of hierarchical granular clustering and establish its algorithmic framework. We show that the proposed model naturally gives rise to information granules that are both of higher order and higher type, offering a compelling justification behind their emergence. In a concise way, we can capture the overall architecture of information granules as a hierarchy exhibiting conceptual layers of increasing abstraction: numeric data 閳拷 information granules 閳拷 information granules of type-2, order-2 閳拷 ... information granules of higher type/order. The elevated type of information granules is reflective of the visible hierarchical facet of processing and the inherent diversity of the individual locally revealed structures in data. While the concept and the methodology deliver some general settings, the detailed algorithmic aspects are discussed in detail when using fuzzy clustering realized by means of fuzzy c-means. Furthermore, for illustrative purposes, we mainly focus on interval-valued fuzzy sets and granular interval fuzzy sets arising at the higher level of the hierarchy. Higher type fuzzy sets are formed with the help of the principle of justifiable granularity. The conceptually sound hierarchy is established in a general way, which makes it equally applicable to various formalisms of representation of information granules. Experiments are reported for synthetic and publicly available datasets.},

  Abstract     = {The Pipeline Risk Assessment using a Fuzzy Systems Network (PRAFSYN) presented in this paper was built using a set of Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLS) arranged in a network to behave as a Virtual Filter and to produce final risk evaluations. The FLS network arrangement contains seventeen FLSs that produce all the risk components detected through the knowledge engineering process, namely: Corrosion, Third Party, Construction, Design, Operation, Sabotage Hazard and Environmental Hazards. The Rule Base of each FLS contains the component of that knowledge describing the cause-effect relationships between the inputs and the corresponding risk contribution or risk factor. This knowledge is stored inside the FLS's Rule Base by means of a linguistic model describing the expert's approximate reasoning strategy to estimate the risks involved. The inputs to every one of the components are the expert identified variables affecting the corresponding risk factor. The risk contributions produced are finally combined within a last FLS containing al linguistic model describing the qualitative relationships between the contributing risk factors and the total risk estimation. All the knowledge was gathered from Houston pipeline experts and every FLS was designed and tested using the UNFUZZY [3] development tool, which allows proper adjustment of design parameters to obtain desired system behavior. C++ source code generated by UNFUZZY was finally assembled to produce PRAFSYN.},

  Abstract     = {We present elements of a frequentist theory of statistics for concepts of upper and lower (interval-valued) probability (IVP), defined on finite event algebras. We consider IID models for unlinked repetitions of experiments described by IVP and suggest several generalizations of standard notions of independence, asymptotic certainty and estimability. Instability of relative freqencies is favoured under our IID models. Moreover, generalizations of Bernoulli's Theorem give some justification for the estimation of an underlying IVP mechanism from fluctuations of relative frequencies. Our results indicate that an objectivist, frequency- or propensity-oriented, view of probability does not necessitate an additive probability concept, and that IVP models can represent a type of indeterminacy not captured by additive probability.},

  Abstract     = {A study was made of the indirect costs that result from pesticide usage in the United States. These costs included: 45,000 annual non-fatal and fatal human pesticide poisonings; $ 12 million in livestock losses; $ 287 million in reduced natural enemies and pesticide resistance; $ 135 million in honey bee poisonings and reduced pollination; $ 70 million in losses of crops and trees; $ 11 million in fish and wildlife losses; and $ 140 million in miscellaneous losses. The estimated total of $ 839 million annual losses attributed to environmental and social costs of pesticide use represents only a small portion of the actual costs. A more complete accounting of the indirect costs would probably be several times the total reported. The results of this preliminary assessment underscore the serious nature of the environmental and social costs of pesticide use. /// Исследовали непрямые убытки, являющиеся результатом использования пестицидов в США.

  Abstract     = {Security risk assessment and mitigation are two vital processes that need to be executed to maintain a productive IT infrastructure. On one hand, models such as attack graphs and attack trees have been proposed to assess the cause-consequence relationships between various network states, while on the other hand, different decision problems have been explored to identify the minimum-cost hardening measures. However, these risk models do not help reason about the causal dependencies between network states. Further, the optimization formulations ignore the issue of resource availability while analyzing a risk model. In this paper, we propose a risk management framework using Bayesian networks that enable a system administrator to quantify the chances of network compromise at various levels. We show how to use this information to develop a security mitigation and management plan. In contrast to other similar models, this risk model lends itself to dynamic analysis during the deployed phase of the network. A multiobjective optimization platform provides the administrator with all trade-off information required to make decisions in a resource constrained environment.},

The cognitive constituent of rClass is underpinned by a recurrent network based on a generalized version of the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system possessing a local feedback of the rule layer. The main basis of the what-to-learn component relies on the new active learning-based conflict measure. Meanwhile, the when-to-learn learning scenario makes use of the standard sample reserved strategy. The how-to-learn module actualizes the Schema and Scaffolding concepts of cognitive psychology. All learning principles are committed in the single-pass local learning modes and create a plug-and-play learning foundation minimizing additional pre- or post-training phases. The efficacy of rClass has been scrutinized by means of rigorous empirical studies, statistical tests, and benchmarks with state-of-the-art classifiers, which demonstrate the rClass potency in producing reliable classification rates, while retaining low complexity in terms of the rule base burden, computational load, and annotation effort.},

The novel two-step approach first models the stochastic uncertainties present within the power system to produced probability density functions (pdfs) for stability indicators. These stability indicators are established for both small and large disturbance rotor angle stability analysis. The pdfs produced are subsequently decomposed into regions based on user-specified threshold values. The outputs from this decomposition are analyzed using fuzzy techniques to complete the risk assessment of instability. The methodology is applied to a multi-area test network into which a VSC-MTDC grid has been embedded to support power transfer from a number of large wind farms. This new combination of probabilistic and fuzzy techniques is shown to provide an effective methodology for quantifying the influence of system uncertainties on the risks of rotor angle stability.},

  Abstract     = {Abstract Fault tree analysis has been widely utilized as a tool for nuclear power plant probabilistic safety assessment. This analysis can be completed only if all basic events of the system fault tree have their quantitative failure rates or failure probabilities. However, it is difficult to obtain those failure data due to insufficient data, environment changing or new components. This study proposes a fuzzy-based reliability approach to evaluate basic events of system fault trees whose failure precise probability distributions of their lifetime to failures are not available. It applies the concept of failure possibilities to qualitatively evaluate basic events and the concept of fuzzy sets to quantitatively represent the corresponding failure possibilities. To demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the actual basic event failure probabilities collected from the operational experiences of the David–Besse design of the Babcock and Wilcox reactor protection system fault tree are used to benchmark the failure probabilities generated by the proposed approach. The results confirm that the proposed fuzzy-based reliability approach arises as a suitable alternative for the conventional probabilistic reliability approach when basic events do not have the corresponding quantitative historical failure data for determining their reliability characteristics. Hence, it overcomes the limitation of the conventional fault tree analysis for nuclear power plant probabilistic safety assessment.},

  Abstract     = {A fuzzy granular structure refers to a mathematical structure of the collection of fuzzy information granules granulated from a dataset, while a fuzzy information granularity is used to measure its uncertainty. However, the existing forms of fuzzy information granularity have two limitations. One is that when the fuzzy information granularity of one fuzzy granular structure equals that of the other, one can say that these two fuzzy granular structures possess the same uncertainty, but these two fuzzy granular structures may be not equivalent to each other. The other limitation is that existing axiomatic approaches to fuzzy information granularity are still not complete, under which when the partial order relation among fuzzy granular structures cannot be found, their coarseness/fineness relationships will not be revealed. To address these issues, a so-called fuzzy granular structure distance is proposed in this study, which can well discriminate the difference between any two fuzzy granular structures. Besides this advantage, the fuzzy granular structure distance has another important benefit: It can be used to establish a generalized axiomatic constraint for fuzzy information granularity. By using the axiomatic constraint, the coarseness/fineness of any two fuzzy granular structures can be distinguished. In addition, through taking the fuzzy granular structure distances of a fuzzy granular structure to the finest one and the coarsest one into account, we also can build a bridge between fuzzy information granularity and fuzzy information entropy. The applicable analysis on 12 real-world datasets shows that the fuzzy granular structure distance and the generalized fuzzy information granularity have much better performance than existing methods.},

  Abstract     = {Feature selection is a challenging problem in areas such as pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. Considering a consistency measure introduced in rough set theory, the problem of feature selection, also called attribute reduction, aims to retain the discriminatory power of original features. Many heuristic attribute reduction algorithms have been proposed however, quite often, these methods are computationally time-consuming. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce a theoretic framework based on rough set theory, called positive approximation, which can be used to accelerate a heuristic process of attribute reduction. Based on the proposed accelerator, a general attribute reduction algorithm is designed. Through the use of the accelerator, several representative heuristic attribute reduction algorithms in rough set theory have been enhanced. Note that each of the modified algorithms can choose the same attribute reduct as its original version, and hence possesses the same classification accuracy. Experiments show that these modified algorithms outperform their original counterparts. It is worth noting that the performance of the modified algorithms becomes more visible when dealing with larger data sets. },

  Abstract     = {We introduce a new structure for fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) where the traditional fan-in structure involving an inner product followed by a squashing function to describe the causal influences of antecedent nodes to a particular consequent node is replaced with a weighted mean type operator. In this paper, we employ the weighted power mean (WPM). Through appropriate selection of the weights and exponents in the WPM operators, we can both account for the relative importance of different antecedent nodes in the dynamics of a particular node, as well as take a perspective ranging continuously from the most pessimistic (minimum) to the most optimistic (maximum) on the normalized aggregation of antecedents for each node. We consider this FCM structure to be more intuitive than the traditional one, as the nonlinearity involved in the WPM is more scrutable with regard to the aggregation of its inputs. We provide examples of this new FCM structure to illustrate its behavior, including its convergence, and compare it with a traditional FCM architecture on a scenario presented in previous works.},

  Abstract     = {Deterministic strategies are still largely used for small signal stability (SSS) assessment and enhancement in most power systems worldwide. However, the solutions obtained with such strategies are very limited since they are correct just around the particular conditions analysed. Therefore it is essential to develop comprehensive strategies to cope with more operating conditions and random factors in SSS studies. This paper presents the development and application of a probabilistic methodology for SSS assessment and enhancement. The approach accounts for uncertainties of generation and nodal load demands as well as the effects of system element outages. Probabilistic performance indexes based on a combination of Monte Carlo method and fuzzy clustering are calculated. It is shown how properly statistical processing of output variables of interest can be adapted to evaluate the proposed indexes, which are the instability risk index and two additional indexes concerning power system stabiliser location and transfer capability as affected by SSS. The results obtained using a 18-power plant power system are analysed and compared against the results obtained through a deterministic approach. Relevant discussion highlights the viewpoint and effectiveness of the proposed methodology in providing instability risk assessment and useful information that aims at minimising the occurrence and impacts of electromechanical oscillations in the context of power system operation around uncertain load conditions.},

  Abstract     = {Accurate and reliable decision making in oncological prognosis can help in the planning of suitable surgery and therapy, and generally, improve patient management through the different stages of the disease. In recent years, several prognostic markers have been used as indicators of disease progression in oncology. However, the rapid increase in the discovery of novel prognostic markers resulting from the development in medical technology, has dictated the need for developing reliable methods for extracting clinically significant markers where complex and nonlinear interactions between these markers naturally exist. The aim of this paper is to investigate the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FK-NN) classifier as a fuzzy logic method that provides a certainty degree for prognostic decision and assessment of the markers, and to compare it with: 1) logistic regression as a statistical method and 2) multilayer feedforward backpropagation neural networks an artificial neural-network tool, the latter two techniques having been widely used for oncological prognosis. In order to achieve this aim, breast and prostate cancer data sets are considered as benchmarks for this analysis. The overall results obtained indicate that the FK-NN-based method yields the highest predictive accuracy, and that it has produced a more reliable prognostic marker model than both the statistical and artificial neural-network-based methods.},

  Abstract     = {Risk assessment is a major part of the ISMS Process. The Information Security Management System standards specify guidelines and a general framework for risk assessment. In many existing standards, such as NIST and ISO27001, risk assessment is described however, while these standards present some guidelines, there are no details on how to implement it in an organization. In a complex organization, risk assessment is a complicated process and involves a lot of assets. In this paper, we present the FEMRA model, which uses fuzzy expert systems to assess risk in organizations. The risk assessment varies considerably with the context, the metrics used as dependent variables, and the opinions of the persons involved. Fuzzy logic thus represents an excellent model for this application. Organizations can use FEMRA as a tool to improve the ISMS implementation. One of the interesting characteristics of FEMRA is that it can represent each risk with a numerical value. The managers can detect higher risks by comparing these values and develop a good strategy to reduce them.},

Moreover, different algorithms for learning pattern trees from data have been proposed in the literature. While showing strong performance in terms of predictive accuracy, these algorithms exhibit a rather high computational complexity, and their runtime may become prohibitive for large datasets. In this paper, we therefore propose extensions of an existing state-of-the-art algorithm for fuzzy pattern tree induction, which are aimed at making this algorithm faster without compromising its predictive accuracy. These extensions include the use of adaptive sampling schemes, as well as heuristics for guiding the growth of pattern trees. The effectiveness of our modified algorithm is confirmed by means of several experimental studies.},

  Abstract     = {Uncertainty is an inherent part in control systems used in real world applications. The use of new methods for handling incomplete information is of fundamental importance. Type-1 fuzzy sets used in conventional fuzzy systems cannot fully handle the uncertainties present in control systems. Type-2 fuzzy sets that are used in type-2 fuzzy systems can handle such uncertainties in a better way because they provide us with more parameters and more design degrees of freedom. This paper deals with the design of control systems using type-2 fuzzy logic for minimizing the effects of uncertainty produced by the instrumentation elements, environmental noise, etc. The experimental results are divided in two classes, in the first class, simulations of a feedback control system for a non-linear plant using type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic controllers are presented; a comparative analysis of the systems’ response in both cases was performed, with and without the presence of uncertainty. For the second class, a non-linear identification problem for time-series prediction is presented. Based on the experimental results the conclusion is that the best results are obtained using type-2 fuzzy systems. },

  Abstract     = {This paper describes an onboard automated hybrid reasoning system for terrain safety assessment using multiple heterogeneous sensors onboard a spacecraft. An innovative feature of this system is integration of multiple sensing modalities and different reasoning engines into a unified approach. Three different frameworks for representation of data uncertainty are considered: fuzzy set theory, Bayesian probability theory, and Dempster-Shafer belief theory. The hybrid reasoning system is composed of three subsystems, namely, multisensor fusion, multidecision fusion, and tier-based fusion selection, where each tier represents a range of spacecraft altitudes. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the multisensor decision fusion methodology described in this paper. The developed capabilities will enable future spacecraft to land safely in more challenging planetary regions with scientifically interesting terrain features.},

  Abstract     = {Owing to the random nature of the lightning phenomenon, the statistical based methods such as Monte Carlo simulation are the best tool to perform the lightning-related studies. However, Monte Carlo simulation is complex and time consuming, especially, for larger networks where a lot of regions must be investigated, separately. Although some researches have been carried out to evaluate the lightning flashover outage rates based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, but, so far, any work has not been reported to perform a risk assessment of lightning surges by means of AI. This study presents a meta-model based on adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that can be utilised to perform the lightning-related risk analysis with a good accuracy. The inputs of ANFIS are tower footing resistance, critical flashover voltage and the rate of lightning occurrence; and its outputs include the failure risk of both the insulation and arrester. The trained ANFIS can be very efficient in terms of time and computational resources for the further analysis, like placement of arresters or insulation coordination studies, on the electrical network on which the training is performed. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the ANFIS meta-model, an optimisation method, based on genetic algorithm, has been implemented in order to find the optimum location of a specified set of line arresters on power network. Also, in order to consider the environmental condition, that is, pollution and altitude, a new method to determine the importance of each node of interest in protection is introduced.},

Then we select eleven lightning risk factors such as ground flash density, lightning current intensity, lightning current steepness, the number of personnel, the equivalent property, relative height, floor space, nature of use, effective spacing, etc. At last by AHP and fuzzy mathematics theory, we obtain the lightning risk assessment formula for Chongqing region. Through the lightning risk assessment method Specific assessment verification shows that this method has better applicability and can better serve lightning protection and disaster reduction in Chongqing region, it can be a good supplement for IEC62305-2 lightning risk assessment.},

  Abstract     = {The main goal of using data with interval nature is to represent numeric information endowed with impreciseness, which are normally captured from measures of real world. However, in order to do this, it is necessary to adapt real-valued techniques to be applied on interval-based data. For interval-based clustering applications, for instance, it is necessary to propose an interval-based distance and also to adapt clustering algorithms to be used in this context. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to provide a platform for performing clustering applications using interval-based data, including distance measure, clustering algorithms, and validation indexes. In this case, we adapt an interval-based distance called dkm, and we propose two interval-based fuzzy clustering algorithms: Interval-based FcM and interval-based ckMeans, and three interval-based validation indexes. In order to validate the proposed interval-based framework, an empirical analysis was conducted using seven clustering datasets, three real and four synthetic interval datasets. The empirical analysis is based on an external cluster validity index, corrected rand, and six internal-based validation indexes, in which three of them can be used in their original proposal and three are proposed in this paper. The obtained results show the usefulness of the proposed interval-based framework for interval-based clustering problems.},

  Abstract     = {A reward and penalty scheme (RPS) in performance-based regulation (PBR) penalises companies for providing poor reliability and rewards them for providing good reliability. In this study, an algorithm is presented to obtain the parameters of RPS for each electric company by using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM). This algorithm is based on system average interruption duration index (SAIDI) and customers' value of interruptions. FCM algorithm is applied to find similar distribution companies and cluster companies into different clusters. The best performer in each cluster is utilised as a benchmark for other companies and DEA is used to set a quality target for each electric distribution company. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in a case study to design RPS for Iranian electricity distribution companies. The results of the algorithm include DEA efficiency score, parameters of RPS and financial risk assessment.},

  Abstract     = {The distribution network operators (DNOs) are responsible for securing a diverse and viable energy supply for their customers so the technical and economical impacts of distributed generation (DG) units are of great concerns. Traditionally, the DNOs try to maximize the technical performance of the distribution network, but it is evident that the first step in optimizing a quantity is being able to calculate it. The DG investment/operation which is performed by distributed generation operators/owners (DGOs) (under unbundling rules) has made this task more complicated. This is mainly because the DNO is faced with the uncertainties related to the decisions of DG investors/operators where some of them can be probabilistically modeled while the others are possibilistically treated. This paper proposes a hybrid possibilistic-probabilistic DG impact assessment tool which takes into account the uncertainties associated with investment and operation of renewable and conventional DG units on distribution networks. This tool would be useful for DNOs to deal with the uncertainties which some of them can be modeled probabilistically and some of them are described possibilistically. The proposed method has been tested on a test system and a large-scale real distribution network to demonstrate its strength and flexibility.},

  Abstract     = {The semantic Web must handle information from applications that have special knowledge representation needs and that face uncertain, imprecise knowledge. More precisely, some applications deal with random information and events, others deal with imprecise and fuzzy knowledge, and still others deal with missing or distorted information - resulting in uncertainty. To deal with uncertainty in the semantic Web and its applications, many researchers have proposed extending OWL and the description logic (DL) formalisms with special mathematical frameworks. Researchers have proposed probabilistic, possibilistic, and fuzzy extensions, among others. Researchers have studied fuzzy extensions most extensively, providing impressive results on semantics, reasoning algorithms, and implementations. Building on these results, we've created a fuzzy extension to OWL called Fuzzy OWL. Fuzzy OWL can capture imprecise and vague knowledge. Moreover, our reasoning platform, fuzzy reasoning engine (FiRE), lets Fuzzy OWL capture and reason about such knowledge},

  Abstract     = {In fault tree analysis, the uncertainties in the failure probability and/or failure rate of system components or basic events can be propagated to find the uncertainty in the overall system failure probability. The conventional approach is Monte-Carlo simulation by assuming a probability distribution for the failure probability. In addition, a new methodology based on fuzzy set theory is also being used in the fault tree analysis for quantifying the basic event uncertainty and for propagating it. However, identification of the components which contribute maximum to the system failure probability is also important in fault tree analysis. Similarly, ranking the components based on their contribution of uncertainty to the uncertainty of the system failure probability is also very important. This paper presents a comparative study of probabilistic and fuzzy methodologies for top event uncertainty evaluation. Further, it explains a new approach to rank the system components or basic events depending on (1) their contribution to the top event failure probability and (2) their uncertainty contribution to the uncertainty of the top event based on fuzzy set theory. },

  Abstract     = {With the spread of active styles of living, regular health monitoring and risk estimation of exercises became an essential part of everyday life. In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based hierarchical, classified risk calculation model is introduced, which can be used to assess the risk level of sport activity in real-time. The model considers the current physical status and the preliminary assessed medical conditions of the person, the activity load of the exercise, as well as the environmental conditions. Based on this information, a hierarchical fuzzy decision making system evaluates the risk level and sends warning (to the person to stop the activity) or alerting (to a medical doctor/hospital) or both if necessary. By this, serious health problems/crisis situations can be avoided. The complexity of the model is optimized by the application of the singular value decomposition-based complexity reduction algorithm. In critical situations [when the available (dynamically changing) amount of time, resources, and data become insufficient], the anytime mode of operation helps to cope with the temporal conditions and to find a tradeoff between the computational complexity of the evaluations and the accuracy of the results. The system can be operated real-time at home, thus making more comfortable and safer the active (preventive) life and rehabilitation processes of conscious people.},

  Abstract     = {This paper presents a wireless risk assessment method to help an administrator manage wireless network security. The assessment method consists of a risk model and an assessment measure. The risk model is in charge of modeling the wireless network risk. Security requirements, wireless attacks, and system configurations are considered in the model. The assessment measure is an algorithm which determines the risk value of the wireless network according to the risk model. Our risk model is developed upon an extended analytic hierarchy process, which contains the 4 layers: the risk layer, the requirement layer, the attack layer, and the configuration layer. The separate layers of the risk model are helpful in dealing with the dynamics of a wireless network because only the related layers are introduced to the assessment measure when changes of the network are detected. Based on the risk model per device, our assessment measure evaluates the wireless network risk in consideration of the relations between devices, attacks, and configurations. Hence, our risk assessment method, composed of the risk model and the assessment measure, can determine the wireless network risk efficiently while considering the dependencies in the wireless network. Two examples are introduced in this paper to examine the feasibility of our method. In the first example, we demonstrate that the risk values derived by our method meet the ground truth by performing practical experiments. The second example shows that our method can evaluate the risk of a changing wireless network with efficiency, and can distinguish disparities in different wireless networks.},

  Abstract     = {In this study, a fuzzy aggregation modeling approach was developed for the cumulative risk assessment associated with multiple air pollution factors and evaluation criteria in a GIS-based air quality management system. This is based on the fact that to assess the cumulative risk from multiple air pollution factors is very difficult due to the existence of various uncertainties and complexities. Fuzzy membership functions were then used to quantify these uncertainties and complexities. In addition, an ordered-weighted product (OWP) approach was used to identify the relative importance of each pollution factor. A number of tasks have been undertaken, including (1) quantification of the evaluation criteria using fuzzy sets; (2) construction of fuzzy membership functions; (3) calculation of the relative importance, i.e. weighting coefficient wi for each air pollution factor; (4) construction of fuzzy aggregation-OWP modeling; (5) assessment of the air pollution cumulative risk. The developed approach was applied to a case study of California. Reasonable results have been generated, which are useful for evaluation of the cumulative risk resulting from multiple air pollution factors.},

  Abstract     = {Risk assessment for security management is a complex process which linked to substantial ambiguous. However, existing techniques of risk analysis determine the solution by the probability distribution junction of threats and its impact loss. In fact, it is difficult for users to collect precise and adequate events to estimate the probability of threats and impact losses. Consequently, a fuzzy risk analysis model is developed to prioritize the risk ranking of assets. The proposed model uses pseudo-order preference model (POPM) to represent the imprecise preference degree of decision maker and determine the ranking of alternative using fuzzy majority concept. It extends the traditional risk analysis using fuzzy multiple-person decision making (MPDM) theory and POPM to risk analysis in fuzzy environment. Finally, a real case of risk assessment for the internet data center (IDC) is given to illustrate our approach.},

  Abstract     = {Due to recent financial crises and regulatory concerns, financial intermediaries' credit risk assessment is an area of renewed interest in both the academic world and the business community. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy support vector machine to discriminate good creditors from bad ones. Because in credit scoring areas we usually cannot label one customer as absolutely good who is sure to repay in time, or absolutely bad who will default certainly, our new fuzzy support vector machine treats every sample as both positive and negative classes, but with different memberships. By this way we expect the new fuzzy support vector machine to have more generalization ability, while preserving the merit of insensitive to outliers, as the fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) proposed in previous papers. We reformulate this kind of two-group classification problem into a quadratic programming problem. Empirical tests on three public datasets show that it can have better discriminatory power than the standard support vector machine and the fuzzy support vector machine if appropriate kernel and membership generation method are chosen.},

  Abstract     = {This paper investigates the passivity problem for a class of uncertain stochastic fuzzy nonlinear systems with mixed delays and nonlinear noise disturbances by employing an improved free-weighting matrix approach. The fuzzy system is based on the Takagi-Sugeno model that is often used to represent the complex nonlinear systems in terms of fuzzy sets and fuzzy reasoning. To reflect more realistic dynamical behaviors of the system, the parameter uncertainties, the stochastic disturbances, and nonlinearities are considered, where the parameter uncertainties enter into all the system matrices, the stochastic disturbances are given in the form of a Brownian motion. The mixed delays comprise both discrete and distributed time-varying delays. By taking the relationship among the time delays, their lower and upper bounds into account, some less conservative linear-matrix-inequality-based delay-dependent passivity criteria are obtained without ignoring any useful terms in the derivative of Lyapunov functional. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed methods.},

  Abstract     = {The rapid development of e-learning systems provides learners with great opportunities to access learning activities online, and this greatly supports and enhances the learning practices. However, an issue reduces the success of application of e-learning systems; too many learning activities (such as various leaning materials, subjects, and learning resources) are emerging in an e-learning system, making it difficult for individual learners to select proper activities for their particular situations/requirements because there is no personalized service function. Recommender systems, which aim to provide personalized recommendations for products or services, can be used to solve this issue. However, e-learning systems need to be able to handle certain special requirements: 1) leaning activities and learners' profiles often present tree structures; 2) learning activities contain vague and uncertain data, such as the uncertain categories that the learning activities belong to; 3) there are pedagogical issues, such as the precedence relations between learning activities. To deal with the three requirements, this study first proposes a fuzzy tree-structured learning activity model, and a learner profile model to comprehensively describe the complex learning activities and learner profiles. In the two models, fuzzy category trees and related similarity measures are presented to infer the semantic relations between learning activities or learner requirements. Since it is impossible to have two completely same trees, in practice, a fuzzy tree matching method is carefully discussed. A fuzzy tree matching-based hybrid learning activity recommendation approach is then developed. This approach takes advantage of both the knowledge-based and collaborative filtering-based recommendation approaches, and considers both the semantic and collaborative filtering similarities between learners. Finally, an e-learning recommender system prototype is well designed and developed based on- the proposed models and recommendation approach. Experiments are done to evaluate the proposed recommendation approach, and the experimental results demonstrate the good accuracy performance of the proposed approach. A comprehensive case study about learning activity recommendation further demonstrates the effectiveness of the fuzzy tree matching-based personalized e-learning recommender system in practice.},

  Abstract     = {The essential role of the particular families of capacities and the capacity identification methods is to help the decision maker to deal with the exponential complexity inherent in the construction process of the capacity. The 2-additive capacities appear to be the most popular among the particular families of capacities since they permit to model interactions between criteria while preserving simplicity. Besides the preference with respect to the decision criteria, most of the capacity identification methods also need to provide the desired overall evaluations of the decision alternatives in the learning set, which is a time-consuming task for the decision maker. In this paper, we propose some models to identify 2-additive capacities only from a kind of refined preference information with respect to the decision criteria called the multicriteria correlation preference information (MCCPI). The MCCPI is a group of 2-D preference information which can be described and obtained by the refined diamond diagram. The common principle of the proposed models is to minimize the different kinds of deviations between the MCCPI and the most desired 2-additive capacity(ies). A multicriteria decision making example is presented to show the feasibility of the proposed methods, and a 2-D scale of the MCCPI is also introduced in the further discussion of the illustrative example.},

  Abstract     = {Failure detection (FD) is an important issue for supporting dependability in distributed healthcare systems to guarantee continuous, safe, secure, and dependable operation, and often is an important performance bottleneck in the event of node failure. FD can be used to manage the health status of communication for delivering telemedicine services, and then to help distributed healthcare system reduce fatal accident rate and increase the reliability and safety of systems. Ensuring acceptable quality of service (QoS) is made difficult by the relative unpredictability of the network environment. In this paper, first, we compare QoS metrics of several adaptive FDs, discuss their properties and their relation, and then propose one optimization over the existing methods, called tuning adaptive margin failure detector (TAM FD), which significantly improves QoS, especially in the aggressive range and when the network is unstable. Second, we address the problem of most adaptive schemes, namely their need for a large window of samples. So we also analyze the impact of memory size on the performance of FDs, and then prove that the presented scheme is designed to use a fixed and very limited amount of memory for the distributed system. Our experimental results over several kinds of networks (Cluster, WiFi, LAN, Intercontinental WAN) show that the properties of the existing adaptive failure detectors, and demonstrate that the optimization is reasonable and acceptable. Furthermore, the extensive experimental results show what is the effect of memory size on the overall QoS of each adaptive failure detector. For our TAM FD, the effect of window size on their QoS is very small and can be negligible.},

  Abstract     = {Risk assessment of road segments is the foundation of risk assessment of transport route risk. So far, most researches on transport route risk are focused on hazardous material transportation, but the method of those researches can not be directly used in ordinary goods transportation. The effort of this paper will be made to study transport road segment risk of ordinary goods transportation. An index system of transport road segment risk is built on the analysis of road segments system, and the risk assessment of ordinary goods transportation on a road segment is achieved on the bases of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and a fuzzy decision method based on continuous-interval-argument ordered weighted average (COWA) operator. The whole process of the risk assessment is not only useful to evaluate transport route risk, but also facilitate the risk assessment of intermodal transportation.},

NASA IV&V Facility is an independent institution which conducts independent assessments for various NASA projects. Its responsibilities, among others, include the assessments of operational risks of software systems. In this study, we investigated independent assessments that are conducted very early in the software development life cycle. Existing methods for risk assessment are largely based on checklists and the analysis of risk matrix. Due to the incompleteness of the available software project information during the very early phases of the software life cycle, it is infeasible to use a quantitative method such as risk matrix to assess the operational risk of the software. We developed a fuzzy expert system, called the research prototype early assessment system, to support independent assessments of projects at the very early phases of the software life cycle. We applied the fuzzy expert system to two previous NASA projects, and the results demonstrate that the fuzzy expert system is a very promising technology for early operational risk assessment of software.},

Inspired by this we review some ideas on the formulation of representative values for interval valued membership grades. We then use this formal correspondence to help transfer these ideas to Atanassov type intuitionistic membership grades. We note while the construction of a representative value requires the satisfaction of some properties, these properties do not completely constrain its formulation and as such leave room for the inclusion of some subjective aspects in formulating representative values. Here we look at different representative values. A particularly notable example of representative values investigated here is what we refer to as the Golden Rule representative value.},

The complex networks consist of several clusters of nonidentical discontinuous systems suffered from uncertain bounded external disturbance. Based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy interpolation approach, we first obtain a set of T-S fuzzy complex networks with constant coupling strengths. By developing some novel Lyapunov functionals and using the concept of Filippov solution, some new analytical techniques are established to derive sufficient conditions ensuring the cluster synchronization in a setting time. In particular, this paper extends the pinning control strategies for networks with continuous-time dynamics to discontinuous networks. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the theoretical results are effective and the T-S fuzzy approach is important for relaxed results.},

Two views of rough sets are presented, set-oriented view and operator-oriented view. Rough sets under set-oriented view are closely related to fuzzy sets, which leads to non-truth-functional fuzzy set operators. Both of them may be considered as deviations of classical set algebra. In contrast, rough sets under operator-oriented view are different from fuzzy sets, and may be regarded as an extension of classical set algebra. },

  Abstract     = {Management of uncertainty is an intrinsically important issue in the design of expert systems because much of the information in the knowledge base of a typical expert system is imprecise, incomplete or not totally reliable. In the existing expert systems, uncertainty is dealt with through a combination of predicate logic and probability-based methods. A serious shortcoming of these methods is that they are not capable of coming to grips with the pervasive fuzziness of information in the knowledge base, and, as a result, are mostly ad hoc in nature. An alternative approach to the management of uncertainty which is suggested in this paper is based on the use of fuzzy logic, which is the logic underlying approximate or, equivalently, fuzzy reasoning. A feature of fuzzy logic which is of particular importance to the management of uncertainty in expert systems is that it provides a systematic framework for dealing with fuzzy quantifiers, e.g., most, many, few, not very many, almost all, infrequently, about 0.8, etc. In this way, fuzzy logic subsumes both predicate logic and probability theory, and makes it possible to deal with different types of uncertainty within a single conceptual framework. In fuzzy logic, the deduction of a conclusion from a set of premises is reduced, in general, to the solution of a nonlinear program through the application of projection and extension principles. This approach to deduction leads to various basic syllogisms which may be used as rules of combination of evidence in expert systems. Among syllogisms of this type which are discussed in this paper are the intersection/product syllogism, the generalized modus ponens, the consequent conjunction syllogism, and the major-premise reversibility rule. },

  Abstract     = {Currently, an increasing number of information/communication technologies are adopted into the industrial control systems (ICSs). While these IT technologies offer high flexibility, interoperability, and convenient administration of ICSs, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. Dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment is a key foundational component of security protection. However, due to the characteristics of ICSs, the risk assessment for IT systems is not completely applicable for ICSs. In this paper, through the consideration of the characteristics of ICSs, a targeted multilevel Bayesian network containing attack, function, and incident models is proposed. Following this proposal, a novel multimodel-based hazardous incident prediction approach is designed. On this basis, a dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment approach, which has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks, is also devised. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the risk assessment, which may be reduced by the redundant accumulation of overlaps amongst different consequences, a unified consequence quantification method is presented. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation of a simplified chemical reactor control system is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation results can clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach has the ability to dynamically calculate the cybersecurity risk of ICSs in a timely manner. Additionally, the result of a different comparative simulation shows that our approach has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks.},

A feedback linearization-based control design framework is developed for general T-S fuzzy systems using its normal form, to achieve closed-loop stability and asymptotic output tracking under relaxed design conditions. A new adaptive feedback linearization-based control scheme for T-S fuzzy systems in general noncanonical forms with parameter uncertainties is designed and analyzed. Some extensions of relative degrees and their possible application to robust adaptive control for noncanonical form T-S fuzzy systems are also demonstrated.

  Abstract     = {A risk assessment method is introduced to the estimation of network security. The method, which combines AHP method and fuzzy logical method, is applied to the risk assessment. AHP method and fuzzy logical method are improved according to the actual condition of the risk assessment of network security. Each risk factor is estimated in the aspect of the probability, the impact severity and uncontrollability. The important degree of each risk factor is obtained. By comparing the important degree of each factor, which risks will be controlled by some means are known. On the other hand, by applying entropy-weight coefficient, the risk degree of the whole network system is obtained, the method of entropy-weight coefficient is applied to objective computation, and subjective judgment is overcome. The study of the case shows that the method can be easily used to the risk assessment of the network security and its results conform to the actual situation},

  Abstract     = {In the previous research of the risk assessment, AHP method and Fuzzy logical method used are obvious subjectivity and limitation. In this paper, AHP method and Fuzzy logical method are improved, the formula of risk degree and entropy-weight coefficient are put forward to the estimation of the information security. Firstly, the hierarchy structure of the risk assessment is constructed and the method of fuzzy comprehensive judgment is improved according to the actual condition of the information security. Secondly, the risk degree put forward is likelihood estimation of the risk probability, the risk impact severity and risk uncontrollability. Finally, for the determination of the weight vector of the risk factor, a method of entropy-weight coefficient is applied to objective computation, and subjective judgment is overcome. The study of the case shows that the method can be easily used to the risk assessment of the information security and its results conform to the actual situation.},

  Abstract     = {We first investigate the fundamental properties of the mechanical system related to the control design. Then, a new optimal robust control is proposed for mechanical systems with fuzzy uncertainty. Fuzzy set theory is used to describe the uncertainty in the mechanical system. The desirable system performance is deterministic (assuring the bottom line) as well as fuzzy (enhancing the cost consideration). The proposed control is deterministic and is not the usual if-then rule based. The resulting controlled system is uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded proved via the Lyapunov minimax approach. A performance index (the combined cost, which includes average fuzzy system performance and control effort) is proposed based on the fuzzy information. The optimal design problem associated with the control can then be solved by minimizing the performance index. The resulting control design is systematic and is able to guarantee the deterministic performance, as well as minimizing the cost. In the end, a mechanical system is chosen for demonstration.},

  Abstract     = {Web-based systems have enjoyed tremendous growth in both theory and applications. They are highly visible and influential realizations of user-oriented technology supporting numerous human pursuits realized across the e-service. In this paper, we focus on web-based e-service systems for the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) remote control. These systems can provide web services for updating factors and the fuzzy law of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy, when the PMSM devices are required. This paper designs the controller of the PMSM with uncertain inertia and friction factors working under load noise in Web-based e-service systems. This controller is based on rotor field-oriented control (RFOC) structures, internal model control (IMC), and improved direct adaptive fuzzy (IDAF). In order to enhance the transient quality for the case of uncertain inertia and friction factors, we use the IDAF algorithm for the outer loop (speed loop). The IDAF is designed based on the direct adaptive fuzzy algorithm combined with the G-Fuzzy system for adjusting online updating adaption factors. The essence of IDAF is a self-learning and self-adaption system with enhanced adaptive ability through the G-Fuzzy system. For the inner loop (current loop), an improved IMC (IIMC) structure is proposed to reduce the effect of load noise. The IIMC combines the tradition IMC and a speed feedback loop to enhance the antiload noise ability of the system. The difference between our control structure and the traditional control structure is that the system could automatically realize antiload noise in the inner loop before adjusting the speed in the outer loop. This will create really high performances for PMSM control systems. We also demonstrate the effect of this control algorithm on PMSM-RFOC system control. The extensive simulation results demonstrate that the current response satisfies the condition of ability and settling time. Especially, the antiload noise ability and transient quality of the s- stem are controlled independently. Thus, it is a solid foundation upon which to develop a high-quality PMSM electric drive in the e-service.},

  Abstract     = {Compared with the observable behavior, it is difficult to predict the hidden behavior of a complex system. In the existing methods for predicting the hidden behavior, a lot of testing data (usually quantitative information) are needed to be sampled. However, some complex engineering systems have the following characteristics: 1) The systems cannot be tested periodically, and the observable information is incomplete; 2) the change process of hidden behavior may be affected by the test; and 3) only part of quantitative information and qualitative knowledge (i.e., semiquantitative information) may be obtained. These characteristics all related to the test are named as testing influence for simplicity. Although a model and a corresponding optimal algorithm for training the model parameters have been proposed to predict the hidden behavior on the basis of semiquantitative information and belief rule base (BRB), the testing influence has not been considered. In order to solve the above problems, a new BRB-based model, which can use the semiquantitative information, is proposed under testing influence in this paper. In the newly proposed forecasting model, there are some parameters of which the initial values are usually assigned by experts and may not be accurate, which can lead to the inaccurate prediction results. As such, an improved optimal algorithm for training the parameters of the forecasting model is further developed on the basis of the expectation-maximization idea and the covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy (CMA-ES). By using the semiquantitative information, the proposed BRB-based model and the improved CMA-ES algorithm can operate together in an integrated manner so as to improve the forecasting precision. A case study is examined to demonstrate the ability and applicability of the newly proposed BRB-based forecasting model and the improved CMA-ES algorithm.},

  Abstract     = {Many measures of similarity among fuzzy sets have been proposed in the literature, and some have been incorporated into linguistic approximation procedures. The motivations behind these measures are both geometric and set-theoretic. We briefly review 19 such measures and compare their performance in a behavioral experiment. For crudely categorizing pairs of fuzzy concepts as either “similar” or “dissimilar,” all measures performed well. For distinguishing between degrees of similarity or dissimilarity, certain measures were clearly superior and others were clearly inferior; for a few subjects, however, none of the distance measures adequately modeled their similarity judgments. Measures that account for ordering on the base variable proved to be more highly correlated with subjects' actual similarity judgments. And, surprisingly, the best measures were ones that focus on only one “slice” of the membership function. Such measures are easiest to compute and may provide insight into the way humans judge similarity among fuzzy concepts. },
