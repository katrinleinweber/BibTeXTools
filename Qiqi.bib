  abstract    = {The Industrial Ethernet is promising for the implementation of a Cloud Computing based control system. However, numerous standard organizations and vendors have developed various Industrial Ethernets to satisfy the real-time requirements of field devices. This paper presents a real-time reconfigurable protocol stack to cope with this challenge, by introducing the architecture with a core of dynamic routing and autonomic local scheduling. It is based on the deterministic and stochastic Petri-Nets (DSPN) method to illustrate the performance of producer/consumer based application model, CSMA/CD based node accessing activities, and TDMA based resource allocation for real time and non-real time traffic. Furthermore, the predicted time distribution for evaluating the stability of a control system can be obtained from the proposed DSPN model. It is shown that the DSPN modeling yields good verification analysis and performance prediction results through a real experimentation.}

  abstract    = {The advancement in wireless communications requires the integration of multiple radios into a single platform to maximize connectivity. In this paper, the design process of reconfigurable antennas is discussed. Reconfigurable antennas are proposed to cover different wireless services that operate over a wide frequency range. They show significant promise in addressing new system requirements. They exhibit the ability to modify their geometries and behavior to adapt to changes in surrounding conditions. Reconfigurable antennas can deliver the same throughput as a multiantenna system. They use dynamically variable and adaptable single-antenna geometry without increasing the real estate required to accommodate multiple antennas. The optimization of reconfigurable antenna design and operation by removing unnecessary redundant switches to alleviate biasing issues and improve the system's performance is discussed. Controlling the antenna reconfiguration by software, using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) or microcontrollers is introduced herein. The use of Neural Networks and its integration with graph models on programmable platforms and its effect on the operation of reconfigurable antennas is presented. Finally, the applications of reconfigurable antennas for cognitive radio, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channels, and space applications are highlighted.},

  abstract    = {Infectious diseases remain among the world's leading causes of mortality and years of life lost. Significant attention has been paid to the “Big Three” infectious pathogens-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, and tuberculosis (TB)-but other conditions such as Chagas' disease, dengue, Ebola, and typhoid, as well as multipathogen processes such as viral hepatitis, pneumonia, and diarrhea, also have major global impact. Addressing these significant disease burdens, which disproportionately impact the world's poorest regions, is a multifaceted grand challenge, requiring new solutions and new technologies. Diagnostics enabled by advances in microfluidics and nanotechnologies can be an important part of the solution. Advantages such as smaller sample size, increased sensitivity, and new multiplexed sensing modalities in a point-of-care format can allow rapid dissemination of test results in remote and resource-limited regions. In this review, we provide a critical assessment of the state-of-the-art in use of these technologies for detection of HIV, malaria, and TB. In addition to discussing opportunities and future prospects, we also discuss the need for additional governmental and nongovernmental funding sources to develop these technologies to their fullest potential, and the need for new business models to enable their commercialization and deployment.},

Nearly all services have a need for greater bandwidth, which means that there will be ever-greater competition for this finite resource. The paper explains the nature of the spectrum congestion problem from a radar perspective, and describes a number of possible approaches to its solution both from technical and regulatory points of view.

  abstract    = {Abstract In this paper we comprehensively survey the concept and strategies for building a resilient and integrated cyberâphysical system (CPS). Here resilience refers to a 3S-oriented design, that is, stability, security, and systematicness: Stability means the \{CPS\} can achieve a stable sensing-actuation close-loop control even though the inputs (sensing data) have noise or attacks; Security means that the system can overcome the cyberâphysical interaction attacks; and Systematicness means that the system has a seamless integration of sensors and actuators. We will also explain the \{CPS\} modeling issues since they serve as the basics of 3S design. We will use two detailed examples from our achieved projects to explain how to achieve arobust, systematic \{CPS\} design: Case study 1 is on the design of a rehabilitation system with cyber (sensors) and physical (robots) integration. Case Study 2 is on the implantable medical device design. It illustrates the nature of \{CPS\} security principle. The dominant feature of this survey is that it has both principle discussions and practical cyberâphysical coupling design. },

In previous digital microfluidic setups for bead-based immunoassay, the magnetic beads were suspended for detection. We investigated the effect of bead aggregation in such an immunoassay system and propose the aggregation magnified post-assay fluorescence for ultrasensitive immunodetection on digital microfluidics (AMPFLUID). The detection signal and sensitivity are further enhanced even at the post-assay stage without altering the original assay protocol on employing magnetically triggered post-assay aggregation of beads in a digital microfluidic setup followed by processing of the fluorescent signal. This method is shown to enhance the fluorescent signal with increased consistency and sensitivity after appropriate charge-coupled device (CCD) calibration. This method of on-chip detection allows the fulfilment of consumption of a volume at the nanoliter level and a limit of detection in the range picogram/mL. In our sTNF-RI model immunoassay, only 2.5 nL of sample is required; a detection limit 15 pg/mL is achieved. The decreased uncertainty of the measure is indicated by the error bars and coefficient of variation.},

Among the various post-CMOS candidates, spintronic devices have gained special attention for their potential to overcome the power and performance limitations of CMOS. In particular, all spin logic (ASL) technology, which performs Boolean operations and transfers the output in the spin domain, has been proposed for enabling new capabilities-such as high density, low device count, and nonvolatility-that were previously impossible with CMOS technology. In this paper, first we provide an overview of the history and the current status of the various spintronic devices being pursued by the research community. Then, we describe how spin-based components are integrated into a computing system and the advantages that result. We use a hypothetical spintronic-based Intel Core i7 as a test vehicle to compare the system-level power requirements of ASL- and CMOS-based systems, taking into consideration the unique demands of spin-based interconnects. We conclude with a brief analysis of current limitations and future directions of spintronic research.},

  abstract    = {The Internet has led to the creation of a digital society, where (almost) everything is connected and is accessible from anywhere. However, despite their widespread adoption, traditional IP networks are complex and very hard to manage. It is both difficult to configure the network according to predefined policies, and to reconfigure it to respond to faults, load, and changes. To make matters even more difficult, current networks are also vertically integrated: the control and data planes are bundled together. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change this state of affairs, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns, introduced between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on SDN. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional networking, its roots, and the standardization activities regarding this novel paradigm. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and northbound application programming interfaces (APIs), network virtualization layers, network operating systems (SDN controllers), network programming languages, and network applications. We also look at cross-layer problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this - ew paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN. In particular, we address the design of switches and control platforms - with a focus on aspects such as resiliency, scalability, performance, security, and dependability - as well as new opportunities for carrier transport networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the position of SDN as a key enabler of a software-defined environment.},

The original carbon arc discharge experiment has been repeated with modern power supply equipment with bipolar excitation capability. The carbon arc discharge exhibits the three fingerprints of memristors, including the pinched hysteresis loops, the lobe area changing with operating frequency, and such lobe area approaching zero as the operating frequency increases.},

Specifically, this paper focuses on SDR from a discrete-time sampling perspective and discusses the efforts that are currently being pursued in order to further bridge the gap between these discrete-time samples, the hardware used to generate this information from continuous-time over-the-air signaling waveforms, and the software and digital logic used to process these samples into digital data via baseband processing. Given the extensive deployment of SDR technology across a growing number of applications, such as national defense, public safety, connected vehicles, education, and scientific research and development activities, it is vitally important that the wireless community understands the features, advantages, and limitations of this technology. With its versatility, cost, and functionality continuously improving, SDR has become a viable solution for prototyping wireless transceivers and networks that are much more tailored to specific applications and performance requirements relative to available off-the-shelf wireless solutions. To highlight the advantages and current issues with SDR technology, this paper presents several examples using a recently released, commercially available SDR platform.},

Pregnancy complications increase the risk of maternal and infant death, and are associated with adverse outcomes such as miscarriage, stillbirth, and preterm birth. Lifestyle modifications before and during pregnancy have been shown to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications. This paper evaluates the use of wearable sensors as an enabling technology to motivate healthier lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy. Wearable sensors have been used to track health and lifestyle in general populations. Pregnancy is associated with hormonal, physiological and psychological adaptations that need to be taken into account when quantifying lifestyle, and there is to date no solution available to accurately measure lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy. The main challenges lay in developing algorithms and systems capable of dealing with physiological adaptations, lifestyle adaptations, and enabling longitudinal monitoring throughout pregnancy. Addressing these challenges will open new opportunities towards an integrated and personalized approach to behavior change interventions based on sensor data. Putting such solutions in the hands of consumers will unlock a crowdsourcing approach to quantifying known risk factors, discovering new markers for pregnancy complications, and to answering some of the fundamental questions that remain around adverse outcomes such as preterm birth.},

These critical services include banking, telemedicine, and exchange of technical information. As a result, spectrum resources are in ever-greater demand and the radio spectrum has become overly crowded. For efficient usage of spectrum, smart or cognitive radios are sought after. However, current wireless phones can only select a few specific bands. In this paper, we discuss the advantages of reconfigurable radios in not only increasing the efficiency of spectrum usage but also in potentially reducing the cost of wireless handsets and the barriers for new wireless service providers to enter the market. We review available technologies that make the implementation of reconfigurable radios possible and discuss technical challenges that need to be overcome before multistandard reconfigurable radios are put into practice. We also evaluate the ability of reconfigurable radios in reducing entry costs for new competitors in wireless service.},

  abstract    = {The development of a trustworthy smart grid requires a deeper understanding of potential impacts resulting from successful cyber attacks. Estimating feasible attack impact requires an evaluation of the grid's dependency on its cyber infrastructure and its ability to tolerate potential failures. A further exploration of the cyber-physical relationships within the smart grid and a specific review of possible attack vectors is necessary to determine the adequacy of cybersecurity efforts. This paper highlights the significance of cyber infrastructure security in conjunction with power application security to prevent, mitigate, and tolerate cyber attacks. A layered approach is introduced to evaluating risk based on the security of both the physical power applications and the supporting cyber infrastructure. A classification is presented to highlight dependencies between the cyber-physical controls required to support the smart grid and the communication and computations that must be protected from cyber attack. The paper then presents current research efforts aimed at enhancing the smart grid's application and infrastructure security. Finally, current challenges are identified to facilitate future research efforts.},

Early diagnosis of cervical cancer allows patients to be fully treated. Therefore, there is high clinical utility of HPV diagnostics even with binary positive/negative indication of the presence of HPV in patient samples. Although the Pap smear is widely used for cervical cancer screening, this method still suffers from low sensitivity and specificity. Thus, simple, rapid and inexpensive diagnostic methods are needed to detect the etiology of cervical cancer, i.e., HPV, especially high-risk oncogenic subtypes 16 and 18. Here, we review the existing assays and platforms employed for HPV diagnosis, and highlight recent advances in nanotechnology and microfluidics that potentially enable new approaches for HPV diagnosis.},

Cost and energy per operation have both decreased by more than a factor of 1000. These advances have been fueled by process technology scaling, but the FPGA story is much more complex than simple technology scaling. Quantitative effects of Moore's Law have driven qualitative changes in FPGA architecture, applications and tools. As a consequence, FPGAs have passed through several distinct phases of development. These phases, termed “Ages” in this paper, are The Age of Invention, The Age of Expansion and The Age of Accumulation. This paper summarizes each and discusses their driving pressures and fundamental characteristics. The paper concludes with a vision of the upcoming Age of FPGAs.},

However, the programmability of FPGA-based accelerators remains one of the biggest obstacles to their wider adoption. Developing FPGA programs requires extensive familiarity with hardware design and experience with a tedious and complex tool chain. For half a century, layers of abstractions have been developed that simplify the software development process: languages, compilers, dynamically linked libraries, operating systems, APIs, etc. Very little, if any, such abstractions exist in the development of FPGA programs. In this paper, we review the history of using FPGAs as hardware accelerators and summarize the challenges facing the raising of the programming abstraction layers. We survey five High-Level Language tools for the development of FPGA programs: Xilinx Vivado, Altera OpenCL, BluespecBSV, ROCCC, and LegUp to provide an overview of their tool flow, the optimizations they provide, and a qualitative analysis of their hardware implementations of high level code.},

FPGAs, however, are very sensitive to radiation and great care must be taken to properly address the effects of radiation in FPGA-based systems. This paper will highlight the effects of radiation on FPGA-based systems and summarize the challenges in deploying FPGAs in such environments. Several well-known mitigation methods will be described and the unique ability of FPGAs to customize the system for improved reliability will be discussed. Finally, two case studies summarizing successful deployment of FPGAs in radiation environments will be presented.},
