  Abstract    = {The Industrial Ethernet is promising for the implementation of a Cloud Computing based control system. However, numerous standard organizations and vendors have developed various Industrial Ethernets to satisfy the real-time requirements of field devices. This paper presents a real-time reconfigurable protocol stack to cope with this challenge, by introducing the architecture with a core of dynamic routing and autonomic local scheduling. It is based on the deterministic and stochastic Petri-Nets (DSPN) method to illustrate the performance of producer/consumer based application model, CSMA/CD based node accessing activities, and TDMA based resource allocation for real time and non-real time traffic. Furthermore, the predicted time distribution for evaluating the stability of a control system can be obtained from the proposed DSPN model. It is shown that the DSPN modeling yields good verification analysis and performance prediction results through a real experimentation.},

  Abstract    = {Abstract In this paper we comprehensively survey the concept and strategies for building a resilient and integrated cyber–physical system (CPS). Here resilience refers to a 3S-oriented design, that is, stability, security, and systematicness: Stability means the \{CPS\} can achieve a stable sensing-actuation close-loop control even though the inputs (sensing data) have noise or attacks; Security means that the system can overcome the cyber–physical interaction attacks; and Systematicness means that the system has a seamless integration of sensors and actuators. We will also explain the \{CPS\} modeling issues since they serve as the basics of 3S design. We will use two detailed examples from our achieved projects to explain how to achieve arobust, systematic \{CPS\} design: Case study 1 is on the design of a rehabilitation system with cyber (sensors) and physical (robots) integration. Case Study 2 is on the implantable medical device design. It illustrates the nature of \{CPS\} security principle. The dominant feature of this survey is that it has both principle discussions and practical cyber–physical coupling design. },

  Abstract    = {The development of a trustworthy smart grid requires a deeper understanding of potential impacts resulting from successful cyber attacks. Estimating feasible attack impact requires an evaluation of the grid's dependency on its cyber infrastructure and its ability to tolerate potential failures. A further exploration of the cyber-physical relationships within the smart grid and a specific review of possible attack vectors is necessary to determine the adequacy of cybersecurity efforts. This paper highlights the significance of cyber infrastructure security in conjunction with power application security to prevent, mitigate, and tolerate cyber attacks. A layered approach is introduced to evaluating risk based on the security of both the physical power applications and the supporting cyber infrastructure. A classification is presented to highlight dependencies between the cyber-physical controls required to support the smart grid and the communication and computations that must be protected from cyber attack. The paper then presents current research efforts aimed at enhancing the smart grid's application and infrastructure security. Finally, current challenges are identified to facilitate future research efforts.},
