  title     = {Cyber-Physical System Security for the Electric Power Grid},
  abstract  = {The development of a trustworthy smart grid requires a deeper understanding of potential impacts resulting from successful cyber attacks. Estimating feasible attack impact requires an evaluation of the grid's dependency on its cyber infrastructure and its ability to tolerate potential failures. A further exploration of the cyber-physical relationships within the smart grid and a specific review of possible attack vectors is necessary to determine the adequacy of cybersecurity efforts. This paper highlights the significance of cyber infrastructure security in conjunction with power application security to prevent, mitigate, and tolerate cyber attacks. A layered approach is introduced to evaluating risk based on the security of both the physical power applications and the supporting cyber infrastructure. A classification is presented to highlight dependencies between the cyber-physical controls required to support the smart grid and the communication and computations that must be protected from cyber attack. The paper then presents current research efforts aimed at enhancing the smart grid's application and infrastructure security. Finally, current challenges are identified to facilitate future research efforts.},

  title     = {Reconfigurable Antennas: Design and Applications},
  abstract  = {The advancement in wireless communications requires the integration of multiple radios into a single platform to maximize connectivity. In this paper, the design process of reconfigurable antennas is discussed. Reconfigurable antennas are proposed to cover different wireless services that operate over a wide frequency range. They show significant promise in addressing new system requirements. They exhibit the ability to modify their geometries and behavior to adapt to changes in surrounding conditions. Reconfigurable antennas can deliver the same throughput as a multiantenna system. They use dynamically variable and adaptable single-antenna geometry without increasing the real estate required to accommodate multiple antennas. The optimization of reconfigurable antenna design and operation by removing unnecessary redundant switches to alleviate biasing issues and improve the system's performance is discussed. Controlling the antenna reconfiguration by software, using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) or microcontrollers is introduced herein. The use of Neural Networks and its integration with graph models on programmable platforms and its effect on the operation of reconfigurable antennas is presented. Finally, the applications of reconfigurable antennas for cognitive radio, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channels, and space applications are highlighted.},

  title     = {Radar Spectrum Engineering and Management: Technical and Regulatory Issues},
  abstract  = {The radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic spectrum, extending from below 1 MHz to above 100 GHz, represents a precious resource. It is used for a wide range of purposes, including communications, radio and television broadcasting, radionavigation, and sensing. Radar represents a fundamentally important use of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, in applications which include air traffic control, geophysical monitoring of Earth resources from space, automotive safety, severe weather tracking, and surveillance for defense and security. Nearly all services have a need for greater bandwidth, which means that there will be ever-greater competition for this finite resource. The paper explains the nature of the spectrum congestion problem from a radar perspective, and describes a number of possible approaches to its solution both from technical and regulatory points of view. These include improved transmitter spectral purity, passive radar, and intelligent, cognitive approaches that dynamically optimize spectrum use.},
